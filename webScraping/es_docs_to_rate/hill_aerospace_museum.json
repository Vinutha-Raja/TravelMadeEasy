The museum is quite spectacular and very informative. They have a lot of aircraft, about 72 all told. About 50 are located inside and the balance are located outside. The aircraft included fighters, bombers, helicopters and passenger/cargo aircraft and were either piston or jet engine powered. All the aircraft were military, no civilian passenger planes. Most of the aircraft has been serviced at Hill AFB. In addition to the aircraft, there are a number of drones and missiles.\nThere was NO charge to tour the Museum. There is a gift shop but no canteen (restaurant) on site.\nThere is so much to see that we went back a second day. This time, we walked by all the outside aircraft.\nIt was well worth the visit as our returning to complete our tour reflected.",

        "comment": "I visited this museum in the afternoon, after spending the morning at the Antelope Island State Park to visit the Great Salt Lake. I was staying at a hotel in downtown SLC. To go back to the city, I had to drive 15 minutes from the island to a town called Layton. From there, I would get on I-15 going south to SLC. Hill Museum is in Roy which is 5 minutes drive in the other direction on I-15 North.\nI am not an airplane buff, but I still can appreciate the value of this place with its sheer size and the vast number of airplanes -- there are 2 hangars each with about 20+ airplanes, then an outdoor park with about another 20+ airplanes. I also really enjoyed the notes on the placards that explained the historical background associated with each airplane and the details of the wars those planes flew in. I spent about 2 hours there..\nIn short, if you have a special interest in military history or airplanes, then it's a must visit place. If you are just an average person, then it's a nice add-on excursion if you go to Antelope Island to visit the Great Salt Lake, which by the way is a must-visit if you like nature and the outdoors.",

        "comment": "Its quite large. It has indoor displays and outdoor displays.\nThe building you enter houses the gift shop, uniform display and theater and the building is connected to the first indoor airplane display and that building is connected to another indoor airplane gallery. The walkway between the two indoor galleries showcases the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame. Each airplane has a fact sheet type of posting that shows the name, manufacture, engine size, range, etc. as well as its history.\nI went with my history/military buff pilot husband and he loved it. He said he saw a couple of airplanes he had never seen in other well known air museums. Some exhibits make you deeply appreciate those airmen and airwomen who fought for their (and our) lives while confined for hours in tight and awfully uncomfortable looking seats as well as the ground/support crews that provided infallible workmanship.\nWe saw some families with smaller children and the little guys are all happy and in awe with the exhibits. Speaking of families, there is an outdoor picnic area you can drink and eat while watching airplanes. You cant bring food or drink inside but its ok to eat/drink outside and there was a beverage vending machine.\nThe title of this review is coming from a displayed F/RF-4Cs decal: F/RF-4C PHABULOUS PHANTOMS PHOREVER (see the photo).\nPut on a pair of comfortable shoes and go.",

        "comment": "The Hill Aerospace Museum is located on approximately 30 acres on the northwest corner of Hill Air Force Base, about five miles south of Ogden. The museum was founded in 1981 as a part of the United States Air Force Heritage Program and first opened in 1986. It moved to its current facility in 1991.\nThe Museum exhibits more than 90 military aircraft, missiles, and aerospace vehicles on the grounds and inside the Major General Rex A. Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery.\nThe list of aircraft on display is extensive. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, rockets, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.\nWe highly recommend a visit to the museum for aviation enthusiasts, and anyone with an interest in vintage aircraft and the United States Air Force history. It truly is an incredible facility well worth visiting.\nIt is conveniently located just off I-15 at Exit 338, Roy Exit. A gate pass onto Hill AFB is NOT required to visit the museum. Simply take Exit 338 (east) off Interstate 15 in Roy, Utah, and enter the museum grounds through the gate.\nAlso housed in the museum is an extensive, well-stocked gift shop. Food service is not provided onsite.\nParking and admission is free.\nOn our last visit in May of 2013, we spent nearly three hours in the museum. But the exhibits are so extensive and well done, that one could easily spend an entire day, and not see everything.",

Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.\nThe very well stocked gift shop is part of the facility but no food services are present. An excellent all-round museum, focusing of USAF aircraft but very much a top museum in every respect.",

There is a very descriptive display for our heroes that served in Vietnam. The museum is free to visit although there are plenty of donation boxes around the museum.

Because of COVID you can't get into the cockpits of the ones that they normally open cockpits for. This is an average museum and in my opinion falls into the \"if you've seen one aerospace museum you've seen them all\" category. It's not much different than other typical plane museums. It is on Hill AFB but you don't go on base. The museum is very clean and kept up very nicely. We made a special trip up that way to see it and it really wasn't worth it because it's just another plane museum. Still, if you live nearby, or in the area and want to find a place to kill a few hours with the kids, this will do it for sure.",

This one is smaller than others we have seen and does not have the quantity that those places have, but it is still very nice and has an impressive collection. There is a film you can watch, and there are two main indoor areas with planes and helicopters to see. Some are hanging and many are on the floor. They are labeled so you know their significance. Then they have a nice number of aircraft outside that you can walk along the sidewalk to see up close. They also have a small gift shop inside. We spent about an hour and a half here and felt that was sufficient. If you just love airplanes and want to read all the display information, you will want more time. As I think back on our visit here, I remember this small boy there with some other men in his family. He just kept saying Whoa! as he saw all these large aircraft. So that should tell you that the displays are impressive. Enjoyable visit and you cant beat the price...free! And free parking!",

There are planes from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War as well as a small jet used by President Lyndon Johnson painted in the Air Force One colors as well as a an F-16 flown by the Thunderbirds. Almost 100 airplanes are on display in two indoor galleries and an outdoor airpark. Parking is free and admission is free, however there are locked containers throughout the museum to make a donation. The hours of operation are Mon-Sat, 9:00 am - 4:30 pm. They close the gates promptly at 4:30 pm. The museum is staffed by volunteers, many ex-military, who are happy to share information and stories from their time in the service.\nUpon entering the museum you can pick up a map of the facility and stop into the small theater that has short films that, run on a continuous loop, on various aspects of the US Air Force. In the museum itself the planes have a narrative on the plane itself as well as some interesting notes. In addition to planes, there are helicopters, military vehicles, a replica of the first atomic bomb detonated, code name Trinity, as well as other decommissioned ordinance. There are also several areas with short videos set up to give a more in-depth experience to the visitor.\nSome of the more special planes of interest to me were the C-130 Military Transport Plane, the B-29 Superfortress from World War II and Korean War fame, the B-52 Stratofortress (which is still in use today), the B-1 Bomber (a supersonic heavy bomber), the SR-71 Blackbird a strategic reconnaissance aircraft used primarily for covert aerial reconnaissance and a MiG-21 Russian built supersonic interceptor also used by China, North Vietnam, India, Croatia and Romania.\nThere is a gift shop by the entrance selling books, tee shirts, jackets, snacks and other souvenir gifts. It takes a good 2 1/2 hours minimum to see everything and read about the history of the planes but if you just want to do a quick walk through you can do it in less time. You cannot touch the planes or sit inside them but you can take as many pictures as you want. If you have any interest in planes utilized by the US Air Force and want to get a good look at many of them, this is definitely a place to visit and as stated before , the price can't be beaten, even with a monetary donation.",

The museum is quite spectacular and very informative. They have a lot of aircraft, about 72 all told. About 50 are located inside and the balance are located outside. The aircraft included fighters, bombers, helicopters and passenger/cargo aircraft and were either piston or jet engine powered. All the aircraft were military, no civilian passenger planes. Most of the aircraft has been serviced at Hill AFB. In addition to the aircraft, there are a number of drones and missiles.\nThere was NO charge to tour the Museum. There is a gift shop but no canteen (restaurant) on site.\nThere is so much to see that we went back a second day. This time, we walked by all the outside aircraft.\nIt was well worth the visit as our returning to complete our tour reflected.",

The Hill museum is much smaller, but everything else is, including the NASA Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.\nThe Hill museum has an incredible collection, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. There are few \"antique\" planes, but the aircraft are a marvel to see.\nIf you go, plan on taking at least an hour. If you are a buff, plan on three or four hours and you may have enough time to inspect and appreciate the great aircraft.\nOne little display, often overlooked is in a small case to the west side of one building. The glass case contains a couple of photos of a man, Vern Moncur, along with his flight jacket. He was a member of the crew called \"Hell's Angels.\" No, not a motorcycle gang, but the crew of a B-17 bomber that served in the European theater.\nI have been to the museum a few times, but I never have enough time, so I end up returning, only to run out of time on each visit.\nIf you are an airplane or Air Force buff, no matter what you're looking for, you'll find something that will catch your eye and stop you in your tracks.\nThis is a great place to visit, to bring your children or grandchildren. It will inspire awe in them if you take the time to tell what these aircraft were, what they were used for, and how they changed the tide of history.",

They have been able to collect some of the most impressive planes and other military items in our history. And you have a chance to learn about how the items there served to protect us. It is very mush worth the time to spend several hours looking at each item and read about it. Imagine at that time what brave men and women took to the air or on the ground to defend our country.",

Like several others mentioned I have visited many aviation museums, and Hill Aerospace Museum makes the cut for those I want to visit several more times. I need several days - a few hours are not enough really. Many docents are on-site and there a lot of activities for children.\nThe aircraft outside are not restored, but I must say that I like to see these planes in the 'normal' condition they were in when in service and / or recovered. This really gives a perspective on how challenging the conidtions were for the airman and ground crews, and an appreciation of the very hard work needed to restore the aircraft to museum quality.\nAnd admission is free, unlike most of the other better museums, but I still left a nice donation equal to the admission at other museums.",

        "comment": "Have lived in the area for years and treasure this gem. Dropped in from Salt Lake since I had a business meeting in Ogden. The size of the collection and presentation is impressive. Expansion building houses fighter jets, war memorabilia, and humbling tributes to POW's. Numerous aircraft outside catch your attention from the highway. Visited on a weekday shortly after opening. Many visitors were already on sight including a tourists from China. Vets and military service people are typically on sight either at information desks and among visitors since this museum sits near an active military base. Depending on the time of year you can also catch sight of fighter jets flying above the area all through Roy and Ogden. There is a great deal to see and amazing history documented throughout. Plenty of parking, gift shop inside, clean, very friendly people, donations are asked for though not mandatory.",

It could fly from Washington, DC to Los Angeles in a little over an hour. Also like the F-16s. I couldnt believe how big a F-15 was. Two nice galleries indoors with planes from WWII to Vietnam Nam. Also some large planes outside like the C124 and the B-52. Plan on an hour to two hours to see everything. The price is great - its free, but there are donation boxes throughout, so put a Dollar in each box. Great fun!",

Some of the larger aircraft are located outside and you can get up close and personal with these monsters. Inside the two main hangers there are many many aircraft from the Wright Brothers through very modern fighter aircraft. You can get closer than you will ever get to any military aircraft in the world. The Hill Aerospace Museum I feel closely rivals the Wright Patterson museum. If you are local or visiting you really should plan to spend some time here. Admission is free and the museum is located just off I-15 Roy exit. Great for all ages",

        "comment": "This museum has a relatively large collection of military aircraft that spans most of the history of the U.S. Airforce. There is an outdoor and two indoor collections, and all are well-maintained, with well-designed displays and placards giving the history and information about each aircraft displayed. Admission is free, which is pretty remarkable,and kids really enjoy being able to get up close and personal with the aircraft. The only down side is that there are no planes in which you can tour or see the inside. The museum also provides some great stories, with its \"Utah Aviation Hall of Fame\" exhibit, and the USAF in Vietnam exhibit, which includes a section on prisoners of war and USAF (Vietnam) Medal of Honor recipients. If you have any interest at all in military aviation - or think you might possibly have an interest - this museum is well worth the visit.",

The buildings are provided by the USAF and most staffing is provided by retired airmen. The hardware has been restored and several of the planes have a connection to Utah flyers and Hill AFB. Two hangers house many planes from the Wright Flyer replica to the SR71 Blackbird. Posters do a good job of describing the displays and give some of the historic events that these planes were involved in. Talking to some of these volunteers brings back memories of my time in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). I flew as a passenger is a few of these planes and seen many of them on radar screens. Exiting the buildings there is a static display of several of the larger planes including a B1B, B52 and a C119 Flying Boxcar which I had flew in back in 1963. All of this is free but you will be inspired to make a donation before leaving. Great!",

The museum is quite spectacular and very informative. They have a lot of aircraft, about 72 all told. About 50 are located inside and the balance are located outside. The aircraft included fighters, bombers, helicopters and passenger/cargo aircraft and were either piston or jet engine powered. All the aircraft were military, no civilian passenger planes. Most of the aircraft has been serviced at Hill AFB. In addition to the aircraft, there are a number of drones and missiles.\nThere was NO charge to tour the Museum. There is a gift shop but no canteen (restaurant) on site.\nThere is so much to see that we went back a second day. This time, we walked by all the outside aircraft.\nIt was well worth the visit as our returning to complete our tour reflected.",

The Hill museum is much smaller, but everything else is, including the NASA Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.\nThe Hill museum has an incredible collection, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. There are few \"antique\" planes, but the aircraft are a marvel to see.\nIf you go, plan on taking at least an hour. If you are a buff, plan on three or four hours and you may have enough time to inspect and appreciate the great aircraft.\nOne little display, often overlooked is in a small case to the west side of one building. The glass case contains a couple of photos of a man, Vern Moncur, along with his flight jacket. He was a member of the crew called \"Hell's Angels.\" No, not a motorcycle gang, but the crew of a B-17 bomber that served in the European theater.\nI have been to the museum a few times, but I never have enough time, so I end up returning, only to run out of time on each visit.\nIf you are an airplane or Air Force buff, no matter what you're looking for, you'll find something that will catch your eye and stop you in your tracks.\nThis is a great place to visit, to bring your children or grandchildren. It will inspire awe in them if you take the time to tell what these aircraft were, what they were used for, and how they changed the tide of history.",

Like several others mentioned I have visited many aviation museums, and Hill Aerospace Museum makes the cut for those I want to visit several more times. I need several days - a few hours are not enough really. Many docents are on-site and there a lot of activities for children.\nThe aircraft outside are not restored, but I must say that I like to see these planes in the 'normal' condition they were in when in service and / or recovered. This really gives a perspective on how challenging the conidtions were for the airman and ground crews, and an appreciation of the very hard work needed to restore the aircraft to museum quality.\nAnd admission is free, unlike most of the other better museums, but I still left a nice donation equal to the admission at other museums.",

        "comment": "An impressive collection of USAF aircraft spanning a century of aviation. The museum is made up of two hangers and an outside area where the larger aircraft are displayed. All aircraft have accompanying information panels and the hangers tell the story of American air power from WWI up to the modern day. The aircraft are maintained in excellent condition and knowledgeable and enthusiastic museum volunteers are on hand to answer any questions you may have.\nEntry is free but Id strongly recommend you make a donation - this museum is a labour of love and well worth a visit!",

        "comment": "I visited this museum in the afternoon, after spending the morning at the Antelope Island State Park to visit the Great Salt Lake. I was staying at a hotel in downtown SLC. To go back to the city, I had to drive 15 minutes from the island to a town called Layton. From there, I would get on I-15 going south to SLC. Hill Museum is in Roy which is 5 minutes drive in the other direction on I-15 North.\nI am not an airplane buff, but I still can appreciate the value of this place with its sheer size and the vast number of airplanes -- there are 2 hangars each with about 20+ airplanes, then an outdoor park with about another 20+ airplanes. I also really enjoyed the notes on the placards that explained the historical background associated with each airplane and the details of the wars those planes flew in. I spent about 2 hours there..\nIn short, if you have a special interest in military history or airplanes, then it's a must visit place. If you are just an average person, then it's a nice add-on excursion if you go to Antelope Island to visit the Great Salt Lake, which by the way is a must-visit if you like nature and the outdoors.",

You probably need a minimum of a couple of hours for a very quick walk around, but enthusiasts could easily spend the whole day here. Highlights: SR-71 Blackbird & many other cold war jets, interesting exhibits and no entrance charge. Very close to the Freeway about 25 miles north of SLC. Bonus was the F-35's circling and landing at the active AFB adjacent. I visited mid-May on a Thursday morning and it was very quiet there.",

From the F4 Phantom to the Douglas C-124C Globemaster II which dominates the area and building, the planes represented here are well preserved and still bear original markings and have detailed plaques explaining their place in history.\nMy favorite plane is the B-29 Superfortress and its older sibling, the B-52. The B-29 on display here flew the weather reconnaissance mission over Japan in advance of the twin B-29s waiting over the Pacific ocean with their deadly and war-ending payloads of atomic bombs. Just to be able to touch this piece of American history is amazing. To know that this plane was so significant in ending the Pacific theatre is beyond phenomenal. And to some it may just be an old plane but I am a die hard fan,\nThere is a current F-16 Falcon on display along with Korean and Vietnam era flying machines in all their glory. Add in a few personal trainers and some ramjet missiles and other types of support equipment and you have a great place to visit.\nThe best part is that the outdoor exhibit is 100% FREE!! You can drive in, park, and start to wonder to your heart's content.\nThe museum is an equally attractive event and chronicles how the nearby Hill AFB got its name plus it house even more planes along with weapons and mechanics of the associated planes. Almost every inch of the building is alive with history from the aviation's infancy to its modern day power punch of firepower. Currently, it is sad to see that America has all of this firepower but has declined to use it more expeditiously with current events. But I am waxing poetic here folks.\nSit down and watch a film, read the walls and boards of those who have made history and just enjoy yourself.\nGreat place for kids because the outside displays are all open with no fences to bar you from getting up close. Just avoid hanging on the propellers.\nThe volunteer staff has done an amazing job of keeping the grounds clean and attractive and have tried their best to keep the pigeons at bay. Some of the planes are in need of some repair but they recently underwent painting and overhauls and are a joy to look at.\nBring a sun hat, plenty of water and a stroller for the younger ones and hang out in one of the best displays of American Aviation history in the region.\nAnd if you are lucky, you will catch glimpses of F-22 Raptors, F-16 Falcons, F-15 Eagles, C-130 transports and more taking off from Hill AFB right behind the museum. There are even the occasional A-10 Warthogs and even the rarer B-1 Lancer. The newest attraction at Hill are the new F-35 Lightings but they are rarer still but they are there and take to sky. My personal favorite is the F-22 Raptor.\nHave fun and enjoy yourself.",

        "comment": "Our family of 5 visited the Hill Aerospace Museum, just outside of Hill AFB, on a chilly November Saturday morning. Admission is free. Many planes are on display outside the museum, to observe at your leisure. We signed the guest book and received a map of this huge place. Lots of war memorabilia inside, a movie that we didn't see (no posted show times), and many signs to inform. My husband and his father, a Navy veteran, especially enjoyed the fighter jet gallery. Our 5-, 3-, and 1-year-olds enjoyed the coloring station, manned by a volunteer who had a long chat with my father-in-law about the mission of the museum.\nOverall, it felt dated. I sense that we were not the target audience, as there were not hands-on activities for children nor docents, though I saw plenty of volunteers around. Volunteers did make us directly aware of a demonstration that would be happening (of a generator, maybe?), but we were on our way out the door. Men seemed to be enjoying the museum in groups.",

Many, many planes, helicopters and fighter planes to see. Some you can see inside. Many types of bombs and missiles are on display. You can also see uniforms and many items related to the wars.

There are two galleries inside, and larger aircraft are stored outside. A few aircraft can't be seen in many other places, such as the SR-71 Blackbird. There are also replicas and casings of various bombs and rockets, to include a replica of the first atomic bomb.\nThere is also a lot of factual information on a number of people who played a significant part in either the development of aviation in Utah and/or Hill AFB, or were in the service from the state. Small alcoves showcases the POW experience in Vietnam and the WWII WASPs.\nThere are a number of audio-visual displays, explaining various aspects of Hill AFB, the Vietnam conflict, and aviation in general.\nAdmission if free, although a modest donation is suggested.\nThe only real shame is that they don't have indoor space for the aircraft currently displayed outside - the weather is giving the planes quite a beating.\nTouring the museum is well worth the time.",

The only thing they were disappointed with is the fact that they couldn't go inside any of them. There are a lot of them and it can be quite a walk, so bring some water if it's a hot day. They have paved sidewalks all throughout, so you can bring strollers or wagons for little ones. We then went inside the museum building where there is a small gift shop and a room with other planes and other things to look at. They had replicas of nuclear bombs which was fascinating to see. It opened up opportunities to talk to my kids about war and the men and women that serve our country and protect our freedom. There is no admission fee to see any of this, but they have places where you can put in donations to help with the upkeep of this attraction.

The museum is free, the gift shop offers a nice selection of airplane-related gifts, and there are bathrooms in the main building. If you're planning to stay a while, especially in the summer, pack cold drinks as there are none sold in the store and the only soda machine outside was out of service. As a bonus, the outdoor area offers a great view of the Wasatch Mountains. Oddly, the elderly museum volunteers were cranky on the day we visited. Overall, we had a good time.",

        "comment": "I've lived in this area for over 15 years and had never visited this museum until this summer. I must say, I was shocked at the size of the buildings and the amount of planes on display. Everything was very close up and labeled so that you knew what it was. The museum is nicely laid out and there are even mannequins in period costumes around some of the exhibits. The thing I found most interesting, oddly enough, wasn't a plane, it was a display on Vietnam POWs. They had a replica of a cell at the Hanoi Hilton, along with stories of men who'd served at Hill Air Force Base before (or since) being captured in Vietnam. It was a very interesting story and I enjoyed the way that display was set up very much. I'm not sure I'd give this an overly enthusiastic recommendation for children. My daughter (10) was entertained for about an hour, but after that, she was wanting to leave.",

        "comment": "The Hill Aerospace Museum is located on approximately 30 acres on the northwest corner of Hill Air Force Base, about five miles south of Ogden. The museum was founded in 1981 as a part of the United States Air Force Heritage Program and first opened in 1986. It moved to its current facility in 1991.\nThe Museum exhibits more than 90 military aircraft, missiles, and aerospace vehicles on the grounds and inside the Major General Rex A. Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery.\nThe list of aircraft on display is extensive. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, rockets, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.\nWe highly recommend a visit to the museum for aviation enthusiasts, and anyone with an interest in vintage aircraft and the United States Air Force history. It truly is an incredible facility well worth visiting.\nIt is conveniently located just off I-15 at Exit 338, Roy Exit. A gate pass onto Hill AFB is NOT required to visit the museum. Simply take Exit 338 (east) off Interstate 15 in Roy, Utah, and enter the museum grounds through the gate.\nAlso housed in the museum is an extensive, well-stocked gift shop. Food service is not provided onsite.\nParking and admission is free.\nOn our last visit in May of 2013, we spent nearly three hours in the museum. But the exhibits are so extensive and well done, that one could easily spend an entire day, and not see everything.",

        "comment": "I took my boys, along with the Scouts to the museum last summer and we all loved it. From the bombers and jets outside, to the fantastic items inside. I loved the old bi-planes and my favorite - the B-17! I think that the boys would have loved to stay longer, but we could only stay for 3 hours before we had to head back. Even then I think we saw more than enough. I think that a few trips would be very worthwhile - especially for anyone who has a love of historical and military aircraft.\nI remember my first visit as a scout, where our scoutmaster took us up to a F-4 Phantom and proceeded to tell us stories of his time flying them in 'Nam'. Our recent experience was led by a volunteer from the airbase who was being deployed the next day. He was an actual pilot and the boys loved to hear him talk of his experiences.\nWe will be back soon",

But military aircraft has largely been developed secretely surrounded by mystery, myths of Alliens, and unbelievable achievement. To be able to see examples of this development upclose and touchable is to me more exciting, thrilling, and inspiring than to watch the most are out and futuristic movie about air and space travel. Anything can be done in the movies through models, art work and computers. But what you see at the Hill Air Force Base Museum WE ACTUALLY DID. To see it makes one proud to be a member of the human race. I thank the people at Hill Air Force Base for assembling such a breath-taking array of these aircrafts, and organize and maintain them for us to see that WE REALLY DID IT! (I wonder what unbelievable \"marvels\" are on the drawing boards or evening being flight test as we marvel at what we see at this great museum. If you are even close the it, DON'T MISS IT!",

My daughter (13) and I spent the time downloading photos into my laptop (we've had to do these stops before and, frankly, when you've seen one plane, you've seen them all if you're not interested in them).\nPlanes, planes, planes. I don't know the specific models, but the boys took lots of pictures. There aren't many places for the \"significant others\" to sit and wait. I think they spent about an hour and a half looking at the planes (we knew we were on a tight schedule, so they may have rushed through the museum thinking they might run out of time). The staff/volunteers seemed very knowledgable and even suggested another museum he may like. That was super helpful since I never know what to look for in these things.\nWe decided to wait in a room that was dark (to preserve the artifacts), cool and not as busy. Turned out it was a flight suit exhibit - those were interesting for us to look at.\nAdmission is free (or by donation).",

        "comment": "We live near this museum and I have been taking my children (ages 7 and 5) here regularly for several years. This museum has two large hangars full of airplanes representing the history of flight from the Wright brothers to the F-16. Planes from all of the major wars in the last century are represented. There is also a large yard in front with many more planes to see up close. My grandpa piloted a B-24 in WWII and I like seeing that plane with my kids and sharing their history with them. The volunteers are friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all, there is no charge to enjoy the museum, though donations are gratefully accepted.\nThere is an Education Room in the back hangar where kids can play with science toys. It isn't open all the time, so check in advance if you want to be sure it will be open for your visit. For younger kids there are traditional toys and for older kids (and adults) there are flight simulators and computers. Once last summer a volunteer helped helped us make paper rockets that we then took outside and shot into the air.\nTripadvisor's Ogden address for this attraction threw me off a little. This museum is inside Hill Air Force Base, just west of I-15 near Roy, a smaller city just south of Ogden. You can easily see this museum from the freeway, especially if you are travelling from the south.",

        "comment": "Hill Air Force Base Museum is conveniently located on Interstate 15 about 35 miles north of Salt Lake City. For anyone interested in military aircraft, the Museum displays a very large collection of U.S. Air Force aircraft from about 1940 to 2000.\nThe collection includes famous aircraft from the Cold War period including the B-52, B-47, F-102, F-4, C-124, and many others. The collection includes notable World War II aircraft inculding the B-29, B-24, B-17, P-40, P-51, P-47, and P-38.\nThe large aircraft are displayed outdooors, where they unfortunately show the effects of weather. Smaller and fully-restored aircraft are displayed inside two large air-conditioned buildings where they are well protected but unfortunately parked so close to one another it is sometimes difficult to fully appreciate the aircraft. There are a large number of displays of missles, aircraft engine cut-aways, etc. Admission is free. Access to the Museum is very convenient, because it is adjacent to, but not enclosed in, the active Air Force Base, so there are no difficult admission procedures.\nOne of the most interesting displays focuses on women pilots who served in World War II, mainly ferrying aircraft. I was surprised and saddened to learn that many of these women faced a great deal of hostility from male fliers, mechanics, etc. It is sad that people had time for that pettiness while trying to fight such a major war.",

There are indoor and outdoor exhibits (the larger planes are located outdoors, such as the B-52 bomber). The complete listing of aircraft is on the museum's website. Outside we also saw aircraft landing at the Air Force base which was cool.\nThere are informative displays about each aircraft and even a small military uniform display. Volunteers are on staff to provide insight about the various aircraft. Since my son appeared very into the museum we were given a very thorough tour of the museum by two volunteers, which we enjoyed very much and found very informative.\nThe museum and parking are free and open 7 days a week.
