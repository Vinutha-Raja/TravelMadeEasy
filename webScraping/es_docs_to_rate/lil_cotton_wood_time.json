Great hikes up White/Red Pine and also Albion Basin. Amazing waterfalls in spring and fields of gold aspen groves in fall. You may encounter moose, mountain goats, deer, coyote, and other wildlife if you look hard and hike a little. And of course, winter boasts the iconic Alta powder and Snowbird terrain that make this a destination for real deal skiers.",

It's definitely my favorite drive in the fall. When the leaves are changing, it's an amazing drive. It's also got some nice hiking trails for the summer months. It's a nice break in the summer from the heat in the valley. The trees always smell amazing and there's usually a nice breeze.
I love this canyon and wish I could go back more often.""",

          "comment" : "Visiting family in Salt Lake City, our daughter took us up to Albion Basin in Little Cottonwood Canyon to see the wild flowers. Although mid-July may be a couple weeks before peak season, the hike up the path to the mountain lake was quite spectacular. It's the perfect place to escape the 90+ degree temps down in the City with a breezy mid-70's temperature to enjoy while climbing the trail. There is no shortage of wildflowers in all directions, as well as leftover snow pack in many places. The canyon in the winter is prime skiing area, so there are chairlift towers around, but not enough to diminish the enjoyment of the scenery. There are bathroom facilities by the main parking lot at the trail head. Parking can be a bit hard to find. The volunteers on the roadway will encourage you to park well below the trail and take a tram up to the final parking area, but we took the risk and were rewarded with a newly vacated spot. There are also a few turn-outs along the drive up that offer spaces for 3-5 cars, so it is possible to park short of the trail head and hike the road a ways. We noticed quite a number of couple with very young children in backpacks because the climb is only moderately demanding. Note, that the elevation in the canyon is over 9,000 above sea level, so if you are from a much lower altitude, you may possibly get a bit more winded than you might expect.",

Little Cottonwood Canyon is an eight-mile drive that ends in the old mining town/now ski resort town of Alta. If the steep granite walls didn't clue you in, the heavily bunkered resort buildings and periodic gates and avalanche warning signs would tell you that this drive is not one to be taken lightly in the winter. But in the fall, the foliage is absolutely gorgeous, especially in contrast to the granite. If you want to get out and walk, there is Temple Quarry Trail at the mouth of the canyon. Just keep in mind that there are no dogs allowed anywhere in the canyon (to protect the watershed). Alta itself is a bit of a disappointment as a town, as there is really nothing there except the resort. But as a little getaway to nature that is just minutes away from Salt Lake City, it is definitely worth a visit.",

          "comment" : """On our last trip to Salt Lake, my wife and I had about an hour or so of free time, so we decided to take a drive up the canyon. The road ends at Alta ski resort, so you'll need to turn around and go back to where you came from. Other canyons we have seen actually connect to roads on the other side - such as the drive up to Park City, for example. However, this probably means there are fewer cars along your way.
The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. I'm sure it would be pretty dangerous during the winter months with snow and ice everywhere, but if you are here during the summer months, you have plenty of wonderful scenery to enjoy. Along the way, there are several places to stop and take pictures or just enjoy the view.
The drive up to the top of the road does not take very long - it's only about 9 miles or so from the base of the canyon to Alta. But it also means you can see the entire canyon quickly.
If you love the outdoors, you would love to make this drive.""",

It was sunny, warm, however lots of snow was still on the ground (there was an unexpected snow storm two days before). The paths were freshly groomed by snow grooming machines. The hike was very pleasant, and easy. Most ski lifts were opened, few skiers, a couple of show-shoers.
After climbing to one of the lifts, we sat on rocks to eat snacks and enjoy breath taking views. One complain - as a first time visitor - no trail maps, the official trail site does not specify which trails are not accessible until summer. We wanted actually to go to Cecret Lake, but learned from a local person, that it is truly a summer hike. However we both had a good time on whatever trail that was""",

From the city limits of Sandy to the end of the trail above the ski resorts, the winding road takes you from pines and aspens, through fir and spruce, and up above the tree line. If you're there for the bloom of the spring wildflowers, the views are truly breathtaking.
The fauna can be spectacular as well. The canyon is home to many species of birds and fish as well as squirrels, pine martin, deer, and other Rocky Mountain creatures. This is also the one place where I can almost always spot a moose.
Take a day or just a two-hour drive. Take a picnic or just a bottle of water. Take your family or just a friend, but definitely take advantage of this spectacular natural wonder.""",

Without taking anything away from Big Cottonwood, Emigration, and other local canyons, the views in Little Cottonwood are the best, in my opinion. Even if you don't ski, grab lunch at Alta Lodge -- lunch prices are comparable to an Applebee's or Chili's -- and just enjoy the scenery. In warm weather, drive past the gate at Alta and up the dirt road for even more spectacular views (and great hiking). Follow the road to the parking lot for the camping area, and hike up to the lake. Beautiful scenery and a pretty terrific motorcycle road make Little Cottonwood my top pick for local canyons!",

Located 15 miles south of Salt Lake City it is easily accessible via signs after taking the 6200 SOUTH exit of I 215.
The "Little" has so much to offer visitors in the summer including wildlife viewing, cruising the 2+ mile road along a roaring river and, camping at one of the two camp grounds - Tanners Flat & Albion Basin. Climbing is also popular.
Locals and visitors alike benefit from this beautiful canyon whether or not they leave their car as the sounds, smells, and sights will bring smiles to all.""",

Tram ride at Snowbird is amongst the most scenic trams/gondolas in US, and new restaurant at top is an outstanding place to have a bit to eat, soak up sun and chew on God's scenery. Caution that if snowy, won't see much and road requires chains and/or 4WD with significant fine if you get stuck b/c you drove up with bad equipment (rent the right car at airport if winter). NO dogs allowed including in car (another min. $125.00 fine). Numerous excellent hikes in the canyon, but none are truly easy. Pretty much all are at least intermediate if not hard. 2 ski resorts, Alta, Snowbird are world class skiing, although Alta isn't world class hotels/amenities (people ski here, so this isn't peopled by boards of monied folks.)

However, when the snow melts those same slopes and peaks offer top notch mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, etc. It's also at least ten degrees cooler than the valley in the summertime and offers clean air during the conversion months that make the valley so uncomfortable to be outdoors in. In late May the meadows explode in wild flowers. It is really a site to see and does the soul good after a long week in the concrete and asphalt of the city. Not only free to the public but accessible via public transportation. Food and lodging available at Snowbird, which stays open year round, as does its tram.",
