We took a look the morning we left, and yes, indeed, it appears he is doing so.\nGood to visit for a highway stop. Food is nearby, there are casinos if you are so inclined.

Denner had just completed the Vegas Vic sign that was erected in 1951. The sign was constructed by The Young Electric Sign Company.\nWendover Will was named after the town of Wendover and William Smith, who founded the Stateline Casino. The 63-foot-tall (19 m) sign was intended to draw travelers in from US Highways 40 and 50, later known as Interstate 80. The sign includes 1,184 feet (361 m) of neon tubing.[2] When driving east on Interstate 80 a caption under the sign reads, \"This is the place,\" apparently in homage to Brigham Young. When driving west the caption reads, \"Where the West begins\".",

At the Montego Bay Casino, there's a restored Lincoln Hwy marker--a later alignment of the Lincoln was routed to Wendover then down to Ely. And Wendover was also along the Victory Hwy (back when roads had names not numbers), named for the WW1 veterans. Wendover Will used to sit by one of the casinos some years ago, but now he has been relocated to the west side of town, on the old highway leading out to rejoin the interstate. It's nice to see a remnant of the old road culture survive in 2015.",

He is pretty impressive during the day, but more so at night when he is all lit up.\nThe reception clerk at the hotel says all the locals say Mr. Will is pointing at West Wendover, the town. We took a look the morning we left, and yes, indeed, it appears he is doing so.\nGood to visit for a highway stop. Food is nearby, there are casinos if you are so inclined. You can explain to your kids what he has hanging out of his mouth!",

The kids thought it was really cool to see a 30 ft lit up cowboy in a \"gambling\" town. Completely different from our town. :) There is a grassy area at the base, so you may take pictures. We parked in front of it, just a little off of the road, which is probably not what the township wants you to do, but the traffic was very light. We hopped out very quickly and took a quick picture.",
