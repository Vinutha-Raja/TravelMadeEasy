Beautiful neon welcoming you into this border town.\nWendover is usually a gas and snack stop for us, but we always make sure we at least drive by Will. There is a grassy area to the west and a few plaques. The only issue is I'm not sure where you can legally stop to get a few photos. The road isn't busy but it didn't look like there is an approved area.",

We took a look the morning we left, and yes, indeed, it appears he is doing so.\nGood to visit for a highway stop. Food is nearby, there are casinos if you are so inclined. You can explain to your kids what he has hanging out of his mouth!",

The kids thought it was really cool to see a 30 ft lit up cowboy in a \"gambling\" town. Completely different from our town. :) There is a grassy area at the base, so you may take pictures. We parked in front of it, just a little off of the road, which is probably not what the township wants you to do, but the traffic was very light. We hopped out very quickly and took a quick picture.",

     "comment": "We loved driving from Utah to Nevada on the old road through Wendover into West Wendover.\nIt was such a stark contrast literally one side old town quiet then Nevada big brash and riotously alive all summed up by Wendover Will as historically important as Vegas Vic.\nA bit of history below from wiki\nPat Denner was commissioned to design the sign for the Stateline Casino in 1952. Denner had just completed the Vegas Vic sign that was erected in 1951. The sign was constructed by The Young Electric Sign Company.\nWendover Will was named after the town of Wendover and William Smith, who founded the Stateline Casino. The 63-foot-tall (19 m) sign was intended to draw travelers in from US Highways 40 and 50, later known as Interstate 80. The sign includes 1,184 feet (361 m) of neon tubing.[2] When driving east on Interstate 80 a caption under the sign reads, \"This is the place,\" apparently in homage to Brigham Young. When driving west the caption reads, \"Where the West begins\".",

He has two brothers made by Young Electric Sign Co: Vegas Vic, (downtown Vegas) and River Rick (Laughlin NV). A must see, and the easiest way / beacon to find Smiths, when you run out of beef jerky and bourbon.",

     "comment": "Wendover sits along legendary roads of passage across the desert and salt flats. At the Montego Bay Casino, there's a restored Lincoln Hwy marker--a later alignment of the Lincoln was routed to Wendover then down to Ely. And Wendover was also along the Victory Hwy (back when roads had names not numbers), named for the WW1 veterans. Wendover Will used to sit by one of the casinos some years ago, but now he has been relocated to the west side of town, on the old highway leading out to rejoin the interstate. It's nice to see a remnant of the old road culture survive in 2015.",

There is a place to park and get out to see him and take pictures. We stopped in the day time and them came back at night when he is all lit up with Neon. When in Wendover you must see this.",
