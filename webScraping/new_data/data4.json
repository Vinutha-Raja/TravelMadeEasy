     "comment": "Wanting to take my kids to a museum during covid has been a challenge. With this museum being open, affordable, and showing a few pieces from the Smithsonian; I thought it would be a good fit for my family.\n3/4 of the art work showed nudity or semi nudity. So having children meant constant giggling or covering of eyes.\nI was aware from their website that this museum believes in showing all sorts of art work. But every corner we turned showed more and more nudity work.\nSo I suggest to go elsewhere if that’s not your thing.",

We especially enjoyed the very ancient artifacts and works from Mexico and Central America, and more recent tribal works from Indonesia. They also have a couple of interesting 18th-century paintings with musical iconography.",

I liked the art from Central America of course because I'm from there; also the one from China and Egypt. I'll go again on the first Wednesday of November because it's free. The floors are wooden. This place is so exquisite. Only allowed to take pictures without flash so be careful because it's art and art is beautiful and important.

Signature, lighting, and installation are outstanding.\nThe small collections of objects from around the world are fascinating, and many of these objects are thrilling masterpieces.\nThe building itself is a massive airy sculpture.",

The collection is small but organized in such a way that is clearly intent to be instructional, inviting you to compare and contrast art from various parts of the world. It's a pleasant experience, but with only one or two \"wow\" moments in the collection. My real disappointment was in the tiny representation artists from Utah, or the Southwestern states - of which there are many good ones, and this would be a great showcase for them.",

The museum is not huge but there is good space to accommodate touring exhibits plus the permanent collection. The latter focuses on painting but there is a small diversity including art from India, Pacific Islands, Egypt and some other parts of the world. Keep an eye out for some interesting contemporary exhibitions.\nFull adult admission is $14 (discounts for seniors, students, etc). This is waived for North American Reciprocal Museums members. Also, general admission is free on the first Wednesdays and third Saturdays each month.",

     "comment": "It's fun to go here on Free museum days (First Wednesdays and Third Saturdays). The third Saturdays also have special craft activities that you can participate in. They are aimed for families and children, but I often enjoy decorating clay plates, making a sculpture, etc as well. The museum staff is very friendly and explains the exhibits that are going on.\nUMFA is well-curated, and even though it doesn't have any singular stand alone pieces, it is does have some beautiful works by famous artists such as Renoir and Singer-Sargent. These master works are combined with unique exhibits such as Mayan pottery, Spanish art, and an Egyptian sarcophagus room. It is well worth the low price of admission (especially on aforementioned free days).\nLet it be said that I actually like the streamer room. Sure, it could probably be used for a lot more art in the large hall, and it isn't my favorite Feher piece, but it is pretty awesome to have a Feher piece at all. His work is certainly modern contemporary, which many people don't appreciate; that's fine. But he is one of the biggest names in the US of this generation, and the pink streamers are just another example of his simple trademark colorful design. For the people that don't appreciate the neon pink streamers - at least he didn't paint an entire city lot pink here as he did in New York.\nThere is also a small cafe in the front where you can get cookies, scones, and coffee, which is a great way to end your visit, or hang out while the kids are doing crafts or listening to stories.\nThe parking is the one thing that leaves more to be desired, but if you go on the weekend there is plenty of free parking since permits aren't enforced.",

     "comment": "I was impressed by the quality of this art museum on the University of Utah Campus. It is located in the Marcia and John Price Building on campus.\nThere are different sections in the gallery focusing on high quality art. Much of the art I knew and was impressed by the selection. They have art that focuses on the ancient and classical world, European and American masterworks, Asian art, art of Utah and the American West, and modern and contemporary art. My personal favorite was the art of Utah and the American West which had some stunning pieces.\nThere is an admission charge to the galleries.\nOne can park for free across the street from the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. The parking places are highlighted. One does need to register the car's license plate with the staff at the ticket desk at the gallery.",

     "comment": "This is a little, unexpected, gem. Unexpected, because I didn't think that there would be a museum in Salt Lake City with such high quality, and eclectic, collections. Gem, because it was really great.\nFrom what I gather, the collections were largely the work of one person, who collected, and probably funded, the works on display, over a 20 year or so period.\nThe spaces for each exhibit are thoughtfully done. Some spaces are smaller than others, yet the displays are excellent, each piece well exhibited, and there is no feeling that works are crammed together.\nEclectic, because there is a huge range of exhibits, time periods, cultures. The Oceania Exhibit is small, with each piece of high quality, and some are simply about as good as they get. Ditto for the small exhibit of Buddhist art. The European paintings are excellent.\nWe planned on spending a couple of hours, and decided that we had to return for another visit. The museum merits minimally 3 hours.\nThis would be a great place for a kid to come to time and again, for short periods, to gain an understanding of the huge variety of cultures, periods and art, that the world has to offer. But, then, I am recalling my own early experiences, being taken to museums by my parents, where I was first exposed to the amazing variety of eras, cultures and art.\nI should add that the staff are all very friendly, and made us feel welcomed.",

     "comment": "Compared to other large city museums, this one is quite small. It's like the difference between going to a large grocery store and a convenience store. It has many categories of art, and some quality pieces, but just a few works in each section. Because of my poor sense of direction, I usually get lost in museums, but not this one. It's too small to get lost. I kept thinking, oh, that's all??\nMany large museums have a children's section with hands on activities. This one didn't have a section like that.\nIt didn't have any regular daily tours either. And, the gift shop was small. So, as long as your expectations aren't too high, it's worth a couple hours.",

     "comment": "We have visited the UMFA a few times for special exhibits. Recently we had wanted to see the exhibit on the Bingham Canyon mine. It was very well done, including works from the museum's collection along with borrowed works from various sources. It piqued an interest in us about the process of curating a special exhibit.\nI would suggest that parking could be better marked and explained. The building itself is great with easy access. There is a cafe available, although we did not eat there. We took a quick walk through the gift shop and found it to be very interesting, having some unique items for sale.\nIn addition to the Bingham mine exhibit, we perused the other works on display from the permanent collection. I agree that Salt Lake can and should have a more extensive art museum, but we are pleased with what we have. From the display of the history of the museum in the cafe it is clear that there are many works in storage that could be displayed were there more space and personnel, for instance it referred to a vast collection of Navajo weavings in the permanent collection. I want to see them! It also mentioned a collection of Chinese porcelain. What is in storage that was NOT mentioned!!!\nAs far as current displays, it seems rather heavy on South Pacific island works. We found the variety and quality of paintings from American and European artists to be quite broadly represented. The biggest surprise to me was a video performance work. Usually I scoff, since I consider myself somewhat of a provincial...but it actually captivated me as I took time to watch it. So the museum opened my mind to something new on a rainy Saturday. I loved that about it. Well worth the visit.",

I found its array of American art to be quite serviceable. And the temporary exhibit on the Bingham Mine managed to be moving: and not just earth-moving! While a city the size of Salt Lake should certainly be able to support a greater arts effort, this is certainly a fine basis on which to build.\nNote: calling this the greatest art museum in Utah is unfortunately very faint praise indeed.",

I had never seen such a large hole in the ground and had wondered what that was. This was the largest open pit copper mine in the world, visible from the space station but had a landslide in 2013 which forced them to close the mine. Nice little exhibit about the mine for those interested in such things. Took campus bus from here over to the museum of natural history for free.",

     "comment": "I have visited art museums around the world from the greatest to the smallest and would rate this one as mediocre for a city the size of Salt Lake. I lived in Salt Lake for eight years in the 1980s and concur with the opinion that the visual arts do not receive all that much attention. The permanent collection has a few nice works in several galleries painted in a garish orange that detracts from the paintings. The two special exhibits of note were paintings of the Great Salt Lake and contemporary prints. As an art aficionado, I spent a pleasant enough two hours but will repeat that a major urban center deserves a better art museum. The Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute, Indiana, a city with a metro population of 170,000, has a more impressive permanent collection. This museum certainly doesn't even come close to matching the Toledo Museum of Art in the city where I grew up.",

     "comment": "The Utah Museum of Fine Arts is located on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It is easy to find with signs along the main road. There is limited parking across the street from the museum as well as near the main entrance. Unless there is a football game, I wouldn't expect parking to be much of an issue however. The regular adult price for admission is $7, with discounts for senior citizens and children. Entrance is free for members of the military. However at $7 the museum is still worth it.\nThe museum is small but still provides an excellent selection of paintings and sculptures. Unlike many art museums in the US, this one actually has quality works by famous artists. You will not find any abstract or \"art done by monkeys\" here. They have temporary exhibits that rotate, but don't know how often.\nThey have a selection of Native American, US, Pacific Islands, ancient Egypt, Rome, and others in different rooms. While I was there they had a temporary exhibit titled: Bierstadt to Warhol: American Indians in the West, which was one of the better collections of art about the depiction of Native Americans I have seen at a small museum. The Native American There are signs that provide a background of the artist and the themes which help for those of us not familiar with them. There is also a free audio guide available, but didn't use it due to time restrictions.\nThe museum is open everyday except for Mondays and holidays. This makes it convenient for those looking for something to do on a Sunday. There is also a small cafe and store inside the museum. Photography is allowed throughout as long as you do not use a flash. I would definitely recommend the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. You can take as much time as necessary, but would plan on at least an hour or two.",

This means that the museum lacks a base of cultured donors like the ones responsible for great museums in other provincial U.S. cities (Toledo, Ohio springs to mind, among others.) The quality of paintings and sculptures is low. The exhibits are good for elementary kids who need some art exposure. The curator does have a remedial plan, which is to concentrate on contemporary art. This is a good plan, because there is lots and lots of contemporary art to be found, and nobody knows if it is good or bad until the curator tells them.",

     "comment": "We wanted to go here when we visited Utah last year but the only day we had free then was a Monday and they don't open on Mondays. We had a voucher from a leaflet and were able to get one free entry so bith got in for $7. There were some great things to see with quite a range of stykes and cultures. The only bit we didn't enjoy was the Salt 1 exhibit - we couldn't see any artsitic value in a part-used toilet roll or an empty suitcase.",

     "comment": "This is a nice museum in a nice building; no flashy architecture by starchitect like gehry or libeskind but self-effacing building shows art very well. they do not have big name art like picasso or monet but small though comprehensive collection of european and american paintings as well as sculpture from asia and africa. full details on their website. i did not eat at their cafe. free parking. great place to spend a few hours if you like art museums.",

     "comment": "This place is gorgeous, quiet, peaceful, and amazing. I think it is the perfect place to bring visitors from out of state, other reviews simply draw everyone to one main attraction, temple square. Dont get me wrong the flowers are beautiful there, but you would be missing out on culture and grace if you passed this place up. My advice, if you want true culture, dont miss out on this place.",

I go the the University of Utah where it is located and its a great place to spend a quiet afternoon with a friend or two, but if you are visiting Salt Lake from out of state, it's not worth visiting. There are so many other things to do. My recommendations: visit temple square, the Tracey Aviary, LDS Conference Center, a Jazz Game or, of course, skiing!",

     "comment": "One of the few examples of a real museum in Utah. A large collection of traditional paint-on-canvas, stone sculpture and metalwork art. Frequently features exhibits on loan from international collections, as well as contemporary contributions from local artists. Beautiful atmosphere for those expecting a quiet indoor experience, extremely low traffic most of the time. Stools available if you want to make a sketch or just sit and stare for a while (ask the admissions desk).\nGood for ~ 1/2-6 hours depending on how you like to enjoy a museum, ( I spent 4 1/2 hours there because I like to sketch my favorite works).\ncheep admission and open on saturdays.",
