It was such a stark contrast literally one side old town quiet then Nevada big brash and riotously alive all summed up by Wendover Will as historically important as Vegas Vic.
A bit of history below from wiki
Pat Denner was commissioned to design the sign for the Stateline Casino in 1952. Denner had just completed the Vegas Vic sign that was erected in 1951. The sign was constructed by The Young Electric Sign Company.
Wendover Will was named after the town of Wendover and William Smith, who founded the Stateline Casino. The 63-foot-tall (19 m) sign was intended to draw travelers in from US Highways 40 and 50, later known as Interstate 80. The sign includes 1,184 feet (361 m) of neon tubing.[2] When driving east on Interstate 80 a caption under the sign reads, ""This is the place,"" apparently in homage to Brigham Young. When driving west the caption reads, ""Where the West begins"".","Written September 27, 2017","0","294 contributions"

Stopped in Wendover, and while at the visitor center, saw a post card of Will. The lady at the visitor center proceeded to tell me his history. After that, I just had to see for myself. Pretty cool icon.
Just off the main road, so it worth the 1 minute drive up the road.
Snapped my pic with Will and headed back to SLC. Pretty cool day.","Written September 7, 2016","0","439 contributions"

At the Montego Bay Casino, there's a restored Lincoln Hwy marker--a later alignment of the Lincoln was routed to Wendover then down to Ely. And Wendover was also along the Victory Hwy (back when roads had names not numbers), named for the WW1 veterans. Wendover Will used to sit by one of the casinos some years ago, but now he has been relocated to the west side of town, on the old highway leading out to rejoin the interstate.
