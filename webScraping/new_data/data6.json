     "comment": "I am an airplane junkie. I love getting to go to museums that have anything to do space and aerospace. While this pales in comparison to other museums size wise, it is still definitely worth a visit. For me this was a trip down memory lane. The aircraft that are indoors are very well preserved and cared for. While there are some items that have displays explaining what the items are, there are some that are not labeled. There is a very descriptive display for our heroes that served in Vietnam. The museum is free to visit although there are plenty of donation boxes around the museum. The staff do not bug you about contributions. The staff are also very friendly and want to help. Like I said, it is definitely worth a visit if you have any interest in aircaraft.",

I learned SO much. The staff was so very helpful and I was blown away by their knowledge. They really go above and beyond to make guests understand what they are looking at.\nWe bought some things from the gift shop, the staff in the shop was so friendly and helpful too.\nAfter we spent an hour or so in the museum we ate outside at a picnic table (I packed lunch) and it was REALLY fun to eat as a family under the wing of jet. If you are even slightly interested in jets/planes you will have a ball here!",

Dozens of historical planes, recent historic planes and planes of today. All are in extremely great condition.\nIn addition to the planes there are also wheeled vehicles, sample uniforms from days gone by, and stories about famous airmen.\nAre also docents around the museum willing to talk to you about any of the exhibits; and extremely knowledgeable.\nThere are both inside and outside exhibits.\nI was there for 3 hours and it seemed like I had been there for about 15 minutes. Dozens of photos and some great memories.\nI highly suggest a visit to Hill Aerospace Museum if you are anywhere with in a hundred miles of Ogden, Utah!!",

     "comment": "A pleasant aerospace museum showcasing some vintage planes, most under roof. You get very close to the planes. Because of COVID you can't get into the cockpits of the ones that they normally open cockpits for. This is an average museum and in my opinion falls into the \"if you've seen one aerospace museum you've seen them all\" category. It's not much different than other typical plane museums. It is on Hill AFB but you don't go on base. The museum is very clean and kept up very nicely. We made a special trip up that way to see it and it really wasn't worth it because it's just another plane museum. Still, if you live nearby, or in the area and want to find a place to kill a few hours with the kids, this will do it for sure.",

This one is smaller than others we have seen and does not have the quantity that those places have, but it is still very nice and has an impressive collection. There is a film you can watch, and there are two main indoor areas with planes and helicopters to see. Some are hanging and many are on the floor. They are labeled so you know their significance. Then they have a nice number of aircraft outside that you can walk along the sidewalk to see up close. They also have a small gift shop inside. We spent about an hour and a half here and felt that was sufficient. If you just love airplanes and want to read all the display information, you will want more time. As I think back on our visit here, I remember this small boy there with some other men in his family. He just kept saying “Whoa!” as he saw all these large aircraft. So that should tell you that the displays are impressive. Enjoyable visit and you can’t beat the price...free! And free parking!",

     "comment": "This was one of many times we have enjoyed the Air Museum. I started taking my grandchildren there 20 years ago. The museum itself is a treasure so give yourself time to explore both buildings and outside. It closes early afternoon so be there at least by noon. I’ll always have memories of the excitement my grandchildren showed as they looked up at all the planes - one grandson always had to be lifted up to touch the SR71. One very special time was watching my father and father-in-law reminisce about their days working on airplanes at Douglas Air Force Base. They love this place! I hope you will take time to see an amazing place, I know you will love it.",

Not uncommon to see military vets there offering information.\nIt’s a good place to be an American. Take time to go to Hill AFB. Pay respect and stand in awe of the amazing machines and museum collections of memorabilia because..... we must never forget!",

I made a special trip to Utah and lucked out to see this place.\nGo see it see it now.\nAs a side note there was a gentleman there who I spoke with who told me some amazing war stories again worth the time to talk to the vets.",

They were a true Air Force museum, having only a couple of migs that were not part of the UAAF. What stood out was the placard that explained how each airplane was connected to Hill AFB. They also had a great exhibit of modifications invented at Hill. Well worth a visit. And it’s free!",

Lots of planes inside to see, with a few helicopters to walk into. More planes then I could count, and lots of history about the military base surrounding the Vietnam, Korean, and Gulf wars. Lots of memorials for fallen soldiers and veterans. Great place to spend an afternoon or weekend visit. Will return again in the future, it’s just right off I-15 so very easy to navigate to from the freeway.",

Most planes are inside two large hanger type buildings which makes it suitable for inclement weather days. The larger planes are located outside on an easily walkable site. This is a good spot to take the kids, both young and old alike. There is no admission fees.",

     "comment": "First and foremost this is a great military aircraft museum. There are planes from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War as well as a small jet used by President Lyndon Johnson painted in the Air Force One colors as well as a an F-16 flown by the Thunderbirds. Almost 100 airplanes are on display in two indoor galleries and an outdoor airpark. Parking is free and admission is free, however there are locked containers throughout the museum to make a donation. The hours of operation are Mon-Sat, 9:00 am - 4:30 pm. They close the gates promptly at 4:30 pm. The museum is staffed by volunteers, many ex-military, who are happy to share information and stories from their time in the service.\nUpon entering the museum you can pick up a map of the facility and stop into the small theater that has short films that, run on a continuous loop, on various aspects of the US Air Force. In the museum itself the planes have a narrative on the plane itself as well as some interesting notes. In addition to planes, there are helicopters, military vehicles, a replica of the first atomic bomb detonated, code name Trinity, as well as other decommissioned ordinance. There are also several areas with short videos set up to give a more in-depth experience to the visitor.\nSome of the more special planes of interest to me were the C-130 Military Transport Plane, the B-29 Superfortress from World War II and Korean War fame, the B-52 Stratofortress (which is still in use today), the B-1 Bomber (a supersonic heavy bomber), the SR-71 Blackbird a strategic reconnaissance aircraft used primarily for covert aerial reconnaissance and a MiG-21 Russian built supersonic interceptor also used by China, North Vietnam, India, Croatia and Romania.\nThere is a gift shop by the entrance selling books, tee shirts, jackets, snacks and other souvenir gifts. It takes a good 2 1/2 hours minimum to see everything and read about the history of the planes but if you just want to do a quick walk through you can do it in less time. You cannot touch the planes or sit inside them but you can take as many pictures as you want. If you have any interest in planes utilized by the US Air Force and want to get a good look at many of them, this is definitely a place to visit and as stated before , the price can't be beaten, even with a monetary donation.",

The museum is quite spectacular and very informative. They have a lot of aircraft, about 72 all told. About 50 are located inside and the balance are located outside. The aircraft included fighters, bombers, helicopters and passenger/cargo aircraft and were either piston or jet engine powered. All the aircraft were military, no civilian passenger planes. Most of the aircraft has been serviced at Hill AFB. In addition to the aircraft, there are a number of drones and missiles.\nThere was NO charge to tour the Museum. There is a gift shop but no canteen (restaurant) on site.\nThere is so much to see that we went back a second day. This time, we walked by all the outside aircraft.\nIt was well worth the visit as our returning to complete our tour reflected.",

There are few \"antique\" planes, but the aircraft are a marvel to see.\nIf you go, plan on taking at least an hour. If you are a buff, plan on three or four hours and you may have enough time to inspect and appreciate the great aircraft.\nOne little display, often overlooked is in a small case to the west side of one building. The glass case contains a couple of photos of a man, Vern Moncur, along with his flight jacket. He was a member of the crew called \"Hell's Angels.\" No, not a motorcycle gang, but the crew of a B-17 bomber that served in the European theater.\nI have been to the museum a few times, but I never have enough time, so I end up returning, only to run out of time on each visit.\nIf you are an airplane or Air Force buff, no matter what you're looking for, you'll find something that will catch your eye and stop you in your tracks.\nThis is a great place to visit, to bring your children or grandchildren. It will inspire awe in them if you take the time to tell what these aircraft were, what they were used for, and how they changed the tide of history.",

It was something that was important to Honor and pay Homage to the Veterans that have served our country in the past, present and the future. They have been able to collect some of the most impressive planes and other military items in our history. And you have a chance to learn about how the items there served to protect us. It is very mush worth the time to spend several hours looking at each item and read about it. Imagine at that time what brave men and women took to the air or on the ground to defend our country.",

Outside displays were very interesting and you were able to walk among the planes. Inside the museum had many restored exhibits. The were very well done. A variety of aircraft and individual exhibits were very informative. I've been to several military museums and this wasn't the best but it was good. I'm glad I went.",

     "comment": "I agree with the previous 4 and 5 Rating Reviews, so I will just add a few additional observations.\nThe museum is on an active Air Force base, so in addition to static displays you may get to watch F-35s fly around during your visit, which we did (I could do that all day....). Like several others mentioned I have visited many aviation museums, and Hill Aerospace Museum makes the cut for those I want to visit several more times. I need several days - a few hours are not enough really. Many docents are on-site and there a lot of activities for children.\nThe aircraft outside are not restored, but I must say that I like to see these planes in the 'normal' condition they were in when in service and / or recovered. This really gives a perspective on how challenging the conidtions were for the airman and ground crews, and an appreciation of the very hard work needed to restore the aircraft to museum quality.\nAnd admission is free, unlike most of the other better museums, but I still left a nice donation equal to the admission at other museums.",

Expansion building houses fighter jets, war memorabilia, and humbling tributes to POW's. Numerous aircraft outside catch your attention from the highway. Visited on a weekday shortly after opening. Many visitors were already on sight including a tourists from China. Vets and military service people are typically on sight either at information desks and among visitors since this museum sits near an active military base. Depending on the time of year you can also catch sight of fighter jets flying above the area all through Roy and Ogden. There is a great deal to see and amazing history documented throughout. Plenty of parking, gift shop inside, clean, very friendly people, donations are asked for though not mandatory.",

You can get closer than you will ever get to any military aircraft in the world. The Hill Aerospace Museum I feel closely rivals the Wright Patterson museum.

It was free and had a great display of aircraft that had been stationed or maintained at Hill.\nMilitary retirees volunteered at the museum. They were full of information and stories.\nThe two things I loved most were: 1. the variety of the aircraft, the travel through aviation history from WWI to present. 2. The inclusion of women in aviation history including the WASPS; and 3 the accessibility of the aircraft.\nI would definitely recommend going a trip to Hill Aerospace museum.",

All aircraft have accompanying information panels and the hangers tell the story of American air power from WWI up to the modern day. The aircraft are maintained in excellent condition and knowledgeable and enthusiastic museum volunteers are on hand to answer any questions you may have.\nEntry is free but I’d strongly recommend you make a donation - this museum is a labour of love and well worth a visit!",

There is an outdoor and two indoor collections, and all are well-maintained, with well-designed displays and placards giving the history and information about each aircraft displayed. Admission is free, which is pretty remarkable,and kids really enjoy being able to get up close and personal with the aircraft. The only down side is that there are no planes in which you can tour or see the inside. The museum also provides some great stories, with its \"Utah Aviation Hall of Fame\" exhibit, and the USAF in Vietnam exhibit, which includes a section on prisoners of war and USAF (Vietnam) Medal of Honor recipients. If you have any interest at all in military aviation - or think you might possibly have an interest - this museum is well worth the visit.",

This museum is the result of countless hours of restoration - I can't even imagine. It goes on and on, and when you walk around the outdoor exhibit, you get to see real live jets flying from the base. The gift shop is a great place to find gifts for all the kids in your life you never know what to get. I saw toddlers and senior citizens having fun here, so bring the whole family.",

Has volunteers working it and we had a couple of them that were there when it happened and really explained some of the history as they remember it. We took a lot longer then we thought we would as it was that good and so much. We will stop again as I know we missed absorbing some of ALL the information they have. I will recommend this stop to anyone that will be in the area to plan to take some time too see this. Cost is donation but is so good it would be worth a fee.",

It has an old Airforce One and many other planes. Don't miss it. Once you have walked through both buildings take the time to enjoy all the planes out front. Truly a great place to visit.

The buildings are provided by the USAF and most staffing is provided by retired airmen. The hardware has been restored and several of the planes have a connection to Utah flyers and Hill AFB. Two hangers house many planes from the Wright Flyer replica to the SR71 Blackbird. Posters do a good job of describing the displays and give some of the historic events that these planes were involved in. Talking to some of these volunteers brings back memories of my time in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). I flew as a passenger is a few of these planes and seen many of them on radar screens. Exiting the buildings there is a static display of several of the larger planes including a B1B, B52 and a C119 Flying Boxcar which I had flew in back in 1963. All of this is free but you will be inspired to make a donation before leaving. Great!",

They have two large connected warehouses full of aircraft of all type. They also had many larger planes outside the museum. Grandchildren seem to love planes, trains and dinosaurs. Here in Ogden we have a railroad museum, a dinosaur park, and the aerospace museum. Everyone in the family, from toddlers to grandparents enjoyed the experience of seeing the large variety of aircraft of all eras.",

One was fighters and the other bombers among other planes, missiles, and Hill AFB info. Worth the stop, can spend 1-2 hours and it's free but remember to donate!",

     "comment": "From the Interstate the Hill Aerospace Museum looks like just a few assorted planes sitting in the open. But if you stop in you'll be treated to a terrific display of military aircraft spread over a large outdoor exhibit and two enclosed galleries. An aerospace museum on an Air Force base is a formula for success and the Hill museum does not disappoint. Outside you can walk around a collection of mostly larger planes that includes many of the usual suspects as well as some lesser known models, such as the C-119 Flying Boxcar and the Bomarc missile; maybe the most elegantly designed weapon of the Cold War era and rarely seen at museums. The two large enclosed galleries start with a couple of early aviation replicas then move you directly to WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and a variety of Cold War era planes. Except for a few informational panels WWI is not represented. Don't expect to see other allies represented here. This is almost exclusively a history of U.S. military aviation with just a couple of foreign aircraft thrown in. In addition to the planes, a variety of other artifacts are salted throughout the exhibits with nice displays and good historical text. The Hill museum does a really nice job of personalizing the experience by tying some of the aircraft to notable Utah aviators. A staff of friendly, talkative, and knowledgeable volunteers will gladly answer your questions or share their stories. While not on par with the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, this is one of, if not the best, pure military air museum west of the Mississippi. I know aviation museums aren't for everyone, but if you're into planes, or military history in general; this is worth a visit. Little boys will love it. By the way, admission is FREE.",

Some of these are rare and difficult to find in other places short of the Smithsonian or Wright-Patterson. Among the WWII aircraft on display are a B 25 Mitchell , Republic P 47 thunderbolt (aka jug), Consolidated B 24 Liberator, and Lockheed P-38 lightning, and a B 29 superfortress, - newer aircraft include a Convair F 106 Delta Dart, a Lockheed F 104 Starfighter, Boeing B 47 Stratojet, (wish they had a B58 hustler), Lockheed-Martin SR 71 Blackbird, Boeing B 1 Lancer and a Douglas C 124 Globemaster. the only complaint (and it's minor) is that despite being housed in two buildings and outside static displays they are somewhat crowded inside. Perhaps the best thing about it is that as you head north on interstate 1 - 15 it's an easy off and on.

They have Cargo, Fighters, Recon, experimental, you can see them here. The ancillary displays are very informative and detailed. I would recommend this for anyone whether or not you are a fan of flight. Oh, and did I say it's free? Okay, it's free to park AND admission!! Right off I-15 so easy to get to.",

My favorite is, of course, the SR-71. Simply awesome. Then there is an outside walk to see even more HUGE airplanes. There are former pilots that can show you around or share a few stories. There are activity rooms for kids with flight simulation and other fun things. Great gift shop. You could easily spend hours there. Plan a whole day to enjoy with amazing place.",

You start with a replica of the Wright Brothers' first planes and progress through our country's aviation history. I am glad we stopped by. While we didn't get a chance to try out the flight simulator, we throughly enjoyed our time at the museum. I will surely be paying another visit to the museum with my kids.",

     "comment": "I love aviation, but I hate war. This excellent museum hits both extremes. Viewing all these amazing planes in an almost ideal setting (more on that later), is a testimony to the amazing inventors, engineers, fabricators, and of course, pilots. Learning about airplanes as weapons (e.g., gunnery capable of thousands of rounds per minute), battle details (excellent timeline of Korean \"conflict\") and collateral damage (a history of the Hanoi Hilton) was a very very harsh history lesson. And then there are the B bombers in the outdoor boneyard, each capable of delivering incalculable payloads. All in all, an amazing experience, although hardly a sugar-coated inducement to enlist.\nMy only wish was that there was better viewing access to at least some planes. There are almost no elevated up-close viewing platforms, and none could be entered. I would loved to be able to sit on the flight deck, touch the controls and let my imagination take over.",

It was a bit chilly so we did not get to spend as much time with the displays outside as we wanted. We had the opportunity to visit with two Vietnam Veterans volunteering there.

They have several interactive exhibits, and hangers full of airplanes, helicopters, and several learning rooms. Make sure you try the flight simulator. Bring some extra money and make a donation to restoring planes, or find some treasures in the gift shop that has something for everyone. Enjoy",

Plan on a couple hours, unless you love planes, then probably more. Located at Hill AFB, you might catch some Air Force planes flying around also.",

It was a wonderful place to spend a morning. The exhibits inside and the static displays outside are amazing and the volunteers who are usually veterans are ready to answer any questions you may have. It is so great seeing all the aircraft you might have only read about up close and walking through Air Force History in WWII, Korea, Vietnam and beyond. If you are in the Salt Lake City area I would highly recommend a visit to this museum.",

The inside exhibits are wonderfully managed and preserved. There is No Admission fee, this is a free attraction. Closed on Sundays.

     "comment": "I visited this museum in the afternoon, after spending the morning at the Antelope Island State Park to visit the Great Salt Lake. I was staying at a hotel in downtown SLC. To go back to the city, I had to drive 15 minutes from the island to a town called Layton. From there, I would get on I-15 going south to SLC. Hill Museum is in Roy which is 5 minutes drive in the other direction on I-15 North.\nI am not an airplane buff, but I still can appreciate the value of this place with its sheer size and the vast number of airplanes -- there are 2 hangars each with about 20+ airplanes, then an outdoor park with about another 20+ airplanes. I also really enjoyed the notes on the placards that explained the historical background associated with each airplane and the details of the wars those planes flew in. I spent about 2 hours there..\nIn short, if you have a special interest in military history or airplanes, then it's a must visit place. If you are just an average person, then it's a nice add-on excursion if you go to Antelope Island to visit the Great Salt Lake, which by the way is a must-visit if you like nature and the outdoors.",

There are lots of different kinds of fly in the sky things. There's also a kids room of sorts which I think is really cool and fun, and a gift shop. I got astronaut ice cream from the gift shop. It made me feel sorry for astronauts because its nowhere near as good as normal ice cream. Also, I should mention that this place is free. You don't have to pay to enter.",

As you go down the driveway to the museum you are surrounded by scores of planes from our military's past and present. Everything from B-52s to B-29s, tankers, helicopters, fighters, a B-1 Bomber and transport aircraft await your attention. The museum building itself houses more fighters and bombers, rescue aircraft, observation aircraft and helicopters. A Wright Flyer and WW1 Jenny are present. Everything is spotless. You can feel the history and courage of our Air Crews. If you are in Utah you cannot miss seeing this. Except for Wright Patterson in Ohio there is no better or larger collection of historical aircraft. My family loved this place. Amazingly, there is no charge to see all this. You can make a donation of you want, but no one will bother you if you do not choose to do so.",

The huge, supersonic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, the fastest plane ever built, is an obvious highlight. If that's all you come for it's worth it but there's so much more.

     "comment": "Yes, I said free. No admission charge, no parking fee. And you start seeing aircraft as soon as you turn onto the property - the outdoor display lines the road to the parking lot. The museum tells the story of military aviation in Utah and how it relates in particular to Hill AFB. It shares a freeway exit with the truck gate to Hill, so pay attention to directional signs. (Don't worry; if you arrive at the gate to Hill, they will politely turn you around rather than shoot you). They cram a remarkable number of large aircraft into two relatively small indoor halls. The really big planes (including a B-52) are located outside. While not as well interpreted (or funded, for that matter) as the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian or the museum at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, the volunteers are every bit as knowledgeable, informative, and helpful. This is well worth your time if you find yourself in the area. The museum is an easy 30-minute drive north from Salt Lake City or just minutes south from downtown Ogden.",

     "comment": "This museum at Hill Air Force Base is just off the I-15 freeway. Easy to get to and easy to get back on the road. The first thing you notice is the large number of historic aircraft parked outside. It could take you an hour just to walk through and examine them in detail, and yes, you can walk up to them and touch. Unfortunately, you can't get inside them. I was surprised to see that since my last visit, they have added a B-52 and a B-1. Just the B-52 was a thrill to see and stare at!\nThen enter the museum itself. The small foyer will not prepare you for the two large hangars full of aircraft. WW1, WW2, Korea, Viet Nam, and Gulf War planes are in there, along with more prosaic aircraft. You (and particularly your children) will love it. And will get sore feet from walking around. A theater constantly runs very enlightening movies about various aircraft. Even the gift shop is a joy to visit.\nOh, and it is FREE. They will gladly accept donations, and you will see that a donation will be given gladly. This collection is worth a large admission fee!",

The Hill AFB Museum is 30 acres with two major hanger areas and outside exhibits with over 90 aircraft and missiles, easily accessible off I-15 without having to enter restricted Hill AFB. Aircraft start in time with a Wright Brothers replica, mainly skip WWI, but have most of the famous fighters and bombers starting with WWII and progressing to the B1 Lancer and SR 71 Blackbird. For history buffs, there are plenty of plaques to read describing each aircraft, as well as videos and other displays of wartime history. You can spend a couple of quick hours or a full day.",

I watched a great video of the P-51 Mustang being flown by the son of a WW2 pilot who had flown one in combat. Staff was friendly and helpful, great souvenir store complete with books about the aircraft and their deployment, all wheel chair accessible. Anyone interested in military aircraft large or small won't be disappointed. The history of the base is on display. Great visit.",

You probably need a minimum of a couple of hours for a very quick walk around, but enthusiasts could easily spend the whole day here. Highlights: SR-71 Blackbird & many other cold war jets, interesting exhibits and no entrance charge. Very close to the Freeway about 25 miles north of SLC. Bonus was the F-35's circling and landing at the active AFB adjacent. I visited mid-May on a Thursday morning and it was very quiet there.",

     "comment": "I love this place as it is only 7 miles from my home and I consider myself an amateur military buff! The second you see this place, you know you are in for a treat! From the F4 Phantom to the Douglas C-124C Globemaster II which dominates the area and building, the planes represented here are well preserved and still bear original markings and have detailed plaques explaining their place in history.\nMy favorite plane is the B-29 Superfortress and its older sibling, the B-52. The B-29 on display here flew the weather reconnaissance mission over Japan in advance of the twin B-29s waiting over the Pacific ocean with their deadly and war-ending payloads of atomic bombs. Just to be able to touch this piece of American history is amazing. To know that this plane was so significant in ending the Pacific theatre is beyond phenomenal. And to some it may just be an old plane but I am a die hard fan,\nThere is a current F-16 Falcon on display along with Korean and Vietnam era flying machines in all their glory. Add in a few personal trainers and some ramjet missiles and other types of support equipment and you have a great place to visit.\nThe best part is that the outdoor exhibit is 100% FREE!! You can drive in, park, and start to wonder to your heart's content.\nThe museum is an equally attractive event and chronicles how the nearby Hill AFB got its name plus it house even more planes along with weapons and mechanics of the associated planes. Almost every inch of the building is alive with history from the aviation's infancy to its modern day power punch of firepower. Currently, it is sad to see that America has all of this firepower but has declined to use it more expeditiously with current events. But I am waxing poetic here folks.\nSit down and watch a film, read the walls and boards of those who have made history and just enjoy yourself.\nGreat place for kids because the outside displays are all open with no fences to bar you from getting up close. Just avoid hanging on the propellers.\nThe volunteer staff has done an amazing job of keeping the grounds clean and attractive and have tried their best to keep the pigeons at bay. Some of the planes are in need of some repair but they recently underwent painting and overhauls and are a joy to look at.\nBring a sun hat, plenty of water and a stroller for the younger ones and hang out in one of the best displays of American Aviation history in the region.\nAnd if you are lucky, you will catch glimpses of F-22 Raptors, F-16 Falcons, F-15 Eagles, C-130 transports and more taking off from Hill AFB right behind the museum. There are even the occasional A-10 Warthogs and even the rarer B-1 Lancer. The newest attraction at Hill are the new F-35 Lightings but they are rarer still but they are there and take to sky. My personal favorite is the F-22 Raptor.\nHave fun and enjoy yourself.",

     "comment": "If you love airplanes, aviation and history, the Hill Aerospace Museum is definitely a \"must visit.\" The collection of airplanes is astounding and best of all, they have an SR-71. This top secret aircraft is the ultimate in every aspect. Cool looking, amazing speed and fascinating history, it's THE plane to see and Hill has one!\nOne of the things I love is how you get a real sense of scale. We see planes flying above so often we forget that these amazing machines are really large and incredible feats of engineering. Being able to walk around, under and touch the aircraft gives you a great new perspective.\nMy only wish is that they would open up at least one aircraft and allow people to sit walk around inside and sit in the cockpit. It would definitely enhance the experience of the visit and make the visit very special. However, it's still a great place to visit and I encourage anyone in the Ogden area to allot a couple hours to see this fun museum.",

     "comment": "Impressive collection and it's still expanding and improving! Dramatic growth and improvement since the last time we were hear many years ago. The displays and signage in the main building are some of the best we've seen anywhere. Love the variety of aircraft and other related displays. Lots on Medal of Honor winners and other prominent veterans and significant people in Utah and Hill Air Farce Base history. Excellent Vietnam prisoner of war area and exhibit. Helps put the Hanoi Hilton and prisoner experience into perspective for those who do not know about it. Second building and outside are well done and improving, still adding additional areas. Loved the time spent here. Still could only really read and spend time with a fraction of the things here. Highly Recommended!",

Many planes are on display outside the museum, to observe at your leisure. We signed the guest book and received a map of this huge place. Lots of war memorabilia inside, a movie that we didn't see (no posted show times), and many signs to inform. My husband and his father, a Navy veteran, especially enjoyed the fighter jet gallery. Our 5-, 3-, and 1-year-olds enjoyed the coloring station, manned by a volunteer who had a long chat with my father-in-law about the mission of the museum.\nOverall, it felt dated. I sense that we were not the target audience, as there were not hands-on activities for children nor docents, though I saw plenty of volunteers around. Volunteers did make us directly aware of a demonstration that would be happening (of a generator, maybe?), but we were on our way out the door. Men seemed to be enjoying the museum in groups.",

     "comment": "You definitely need a few hours both on the inside and outside of the Hill Aerospace Museum in Ogden, Utah, north of Salt Lake City. A variety of planes are set on the field outside of the museum so you can sense the size as you walk around them . A pamphlet describing the planes is available at the door. Inside the free museum, volunteer Air Force vets will share the stories of the planes they flew. You will see neat rows of planes lined up, video historical footage of plane battles, displays and narratives explaining the start of the wars, use of the planes, etc. A narrative of both the Korean and Viet Nam War is also on display, a great history lesson for both adults and kids. You can view the size of POW cells and number of pilots captured, tortured and murdered during the Viet Nam War. View first hand the short-hand tapping for communication between POW'S. You don't have to be an airplane buff to enjoy this museum. You are able to see the progress in design and\ntechnology in each generation of planes. Also on display, pilots uniforms and flight suits of different time periods. There is also a Museum Gift Shop on site.",

Great volunteers who will answer your questions about the exhibits. If you are traveling through the Roy area on I-15, plan a lunch stop here. You can eat under the wings of an exhibit and then see the rest of the museum. Plan for at least an hour. The best part of all is it's free.

     "comment": "Located on the edge of Hill AFB, this is a surprisingly large museum going through the history of aircraft used by the Air Force. It is free (donation of $1/person suggested), and they close strictly at 4:30 for security reasons (the adjacent base closes at 4:30 sharp to civilians). You walk in, and it looks pretty unassuming, but then there are two HUGE hangars connected by a hallway with several dozen retired aircraft nicely laid out. The descriptions alongside each aircraft are excellent, as well, and I learned a lot in an hour. The sheer size of the airplanes and helicopters is a real wow factor for our two children (10 and 12), and I couldn't believe it was basically free to visit. About five minutes off of I-15, about 30 minutes outside of Salt Lake City.",

There is an area outside with many planes, helicopters and fighters with explanations of what you are viewing. Inside there are 3 museums, 1 small and 2 rather large. Many, many planes, helicopters and fighter planes to see. Some you can see inside. Many types of bombs and missiles are on display. You can also see uniforms and many items related to the wars. There are veterans present to answer any questions you may have. We spent about 2 hours but more time could easily be spent. Multiple bathrooms and a gift shop. No fee to get into the museum.",

There are a good number of aircraft on display and you can get up close to most all of them. They also have a nice model of an engine that moves and shows you how it operates. Additionally, there are some aircraft outside that you can view. But the museum buildings seem to be cooled by evaporative cooling and not A/C, so while it was cool enough, it wasn't as pleasant as it would have been if there was A/C. Also, the bathrooms were absolutely awful. The trash was overflowing and they were in poor condition and not very clean. The staff members that we came in contact with were okay, but not super friendly. They did have a nice gift shop, though, and plenty of parking.",

There are two indoor exhibit halls, one mostly early aviation to WWII, then the next building Korea, Vietnam, and miscellaneous.\nI found the WWII exhibits very interesting and informative not only on major items, but lesser known aspects of the conflict. I had not known that US soil (Alaska, TH) had been bombed. I knew about the fire/bomb balloons, but not that there were that many.\nI think there are 20 aircraft outside. I did not have time to check it out.\nAs I said in the title, two days wold be needed to really take it all in. I guess I would suggest the early aviation to WWII building, then a break and look outside. Go home and think about it, then on the next visit, look at what you wanted to see more of, then go on to the next building, and spend more time outside.\nOh, and don't forget the gift shop.",

We first went after it closed for the day (not checking the hours in advance) and just seeing the amazing planes in the field meant that yes - the next day we were there when it opened. We first went out and saw the amazing planes outside. Its a wealth of military history.\nWe then went to the theater in the museum and watched some of the very good aviation documentary movies there.\nThen, we went to see the museum. From the outside it doe not look as large as it is. There is also very good information on the different Wars such as Korea and Vietnam, including a display on a POW prison.\nOn the day we were there they were also setting up for a military presentation of medals to some military people (we saw the military men and women arriving for the presentation.)\nThere is also a hall of fame display with excellent write ups and pictures.\nWe have visited a number of aviation museums, and this is one of the best we have been to. If interested in the military or in aviation history, its well worth a visit.\nParking is close to the museum also in a free parking lot.",

There are two galleries inside, and larger aircraft are stored outside. A few aircraft can't be seen in many other places, such as the SR-71 Blackbird. There are also replicas and casings of various bombs and rockets, to include a replica of the first atomic bomb.\nThere is also a lot of factual information on a number of people who played a significant part in either the development of aviation in Utah and/or Hill AFB, or were in the service from the state. Small alcoves showcases the POW experience in Vietnam and the WWII WASPs.\nThere are a number of audio-visual displays, explaining various aspects of Hill AFB, the Vietnam conflict, and aviation in general.\nAdmission if free, although a modest donation is suggested.\nThe only real shame is that they don't have indoor space for the aircraft currently displayed outside - the weather is giving the planes quite a beating.\nTouring the museum is well worth the time.",

If you have little one of all ages (3-103) this is a sight for their eyes.

For those who wish a hands-on esperience, there are dozens of historic aircraft outside the building. Otherwise the aircraft inside are wisely protected from possible abuse by being roped off; visible but not touchable, as they should be.\nThe price is right; donations accepted happily, but no charge for entrance.",

Outside of the building are aircraft just amazing to be able to walk up and appreciate the size of them. Kids will love running around outside to burn off energy. I suggest you go through the first gallery, have a break (no restaurant here sadly - just a gift shop) and come back to do the second gallery. You don't want to become \"planed out\". Really a fantastic exhibit. Well worth the stop. There's even a Walmart close by for those who like to camp free.....",

Exhibits are both inside and outside. Allow 2 to 3 hours to see everything. The volunteers who run the place are anxious to get out at day's end and tend to close up earlier than advertised.",

I was in the area and had the opportunity to visit once again and I don't know if it was really worth my time. The history and planes are amazing, but quite frankly there's not been a lot of change in the past 10 years. There's a marked difference in the planes from the interior displays to the exterior and while I understand the weather can be hard on them, it would be nice to see the larger outdoor exhibits better cared for.\nI enjoyed the visit and had a good time explaining the history surrounding the planes to my kids, but it may be some time before I return.",

It has a nice little gift shop but unfortunately in my opinion it needs couple of vending machines for food so you need to bring your own & have a picnic in amongst the jets outside. Also jet fighters & other aircraft were flying out of Hills air force base so it was an added treat to see them it is a great way to spend half a day at no cost just a donation.",

When you go, don't go through the first building and think that you are finished-there is a second building directly behind the first one that is just as good. The admission to this place is free. It is worth a few hours if you are ever in Ogden area. The only thing that could make this place better was if you could go inside some of the planes.",

It's really quite a huge museum, full of interesting planes, etc. We didn't have time to see the airplanes outside.",

They are ages 9 and 3 and both of them loved looking at the airplanes. This is a free museum and will take you about an hour-90 minutes to get through. The inside of the museum is more informative than the displays outside. I'd like to know why the planes outside are important, or maybe wish they had been labeled to let us know what kind of plane they are. We noticed one of Gail Halvorsen's (The Candy Bomber) planes outside and since kids are becoming familiar with that story, it would be nice if there had been something identifying it. It had his name on the side, but if you didn't know his name, you wouldn't make the connection. Anyway, small critique aside, we had a nice time.",

     "comment": "While you can't actually touch the planes, you can get within inches of F16s, A10s, special ops helicopters, spy planes, and much more. Getting there can be confusing, as although the museum is only 30 seconds off the freeway, it is on Airforce property and is surrounded by a tall fence, however you don't travel through the base to get to it (turn left when you see the checkpoint at the Roy gate). There is a lot of room for kids to run around at the museum, with actual military planes (not replicas or models) parked in both outdoor as well as indoor galleries. They even have benches and picnic tables under the wings of some planes, so it is a great place to relax and learn about military history. I particularly enjoy the museum because the open nature of the exhibits allows adults and interested kids to read the signs near the planes and munitions while still keeping an eye on the more energetic companions who rush to see the next plane or helicopter. While outside you'll likely notice in-service military planes (fighter-jets as well as cargo and surveillance planes) flying overhead to and from the adjoining Hill Airforce Base.",

We got lost getting there - must have tried every entrance to Hill A.F.B. before finally finding the right one! It was close to closing time by the time we finally found it so we had to rush. My husband wanted to see the SR71, so he rushed in to see it and I limped along more slowly and found a handy place to sit down, then another handy place, then another. I didn't see nearly as much as I would have liked - I really enjoyed it the other time I was there and I hope we get back again soon when I'm not so tired. Once again my husband was thrilled with the place, even though our time was so limited. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was very clean - even just minutes before closing time! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning the history of the Air Force and flying. It's a great place - but check out how to get there ahead of time - and when they say they close at 4:30 they mean they LOCK the GATES at 4:30 so you'd better be gone by then!",

Busy days, but worth it.\nThe museum itself is in two parts; an outdoor area where the *really* big planes are, and the indoor area, which is mainly fighters and helicopters. I recommend you try to go during the spring/summer, when the weather is nice enough to wander outside.\nHighly recommended.",

They have a gret variety of planes and you can get up close to them. Yeah it's full of the usual Uncle Sam Patriot stuff but if you look beyond all of that, it's amazing to think that these planes were nook bed in helping to create a more free world. I loved seeing a piece of the iconic White Cliffs of Dover there. It was pretty sweet. My only down side is how it says that World War 2 started in 1941, it didn't, it started in 1939. For any nationality, this place is super fun and you can spend ages just marvelling at its grandeur! Definitely worth a visit if you're up in Ogden!",

The museum provides interesting facts about the history of aviation and air combat. Many retired Airmen volunteer at the museum. Stop and thank them for their service and take time to hear their stories. It enhances my visit and increases my appreciation for those that serve our country. The museum is free to the public however I suggest making a small donation to keep this great Utah museum open for all to enjoy.",

     "comment": "It’s quite large. It has indoor displays and outdoor displays.\nThe building you enter houses the gift shop, uniform display and theater and the building is connected to the first indoor airplane display and that building is connected to another indoor airplane gallery. The walkway between the two indoor galleries showcases the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame. Each airplane has a “fact sheet” type of posting that shows the name, manufacture, engine size, range, etc. as well as its history.\nI went with my history/military buff pilot husband and he loved it. He said he saw a couple of airplanes he had never seen in other well known air museums. Some exhibits make you deeply appreciate those airmen and airwomen who fought for their (and our) lives while confined for hours in tight and awfully uncomfortable looking seats as well as the ground/support crews that provided infallible workmanship.\nWe saw some families with smaller children and the little guys are all happy and in awe with the exhibits. Speaking of families, there is an outdoor picnic area you can drink and eat while watching airplanes. You can’t bring food or drink inside but it’s ok to eat/drink outside and there was a beverage vending machine.\nThe title of this review is coming from a displayed F/RF-4C’s decal: F/RF-4C PHABULOUS PHANTOMS PHOREVER (see the photo).\nPut on a pair of comfortable shoes and go.",

And this museum really touched a chord. It has them all, from some obscure models to the latest in military examples of planes that have been our protectors. They have transporters, fighters, bombers, drones, helicopters, antiques, and even a lot of displays which show what pilots wore, how they were housed in the various conflicts that our country has been involved in. An incredible indoor array, and an awesome walkway with some of the more gigantic of the planes that have flown for us. And we had three of my great-grandchildren with us, and they even enjoyed all those planes... Come see if you're in Utah, it's awesome...",

Some were so huge and it was crazy to be standing right next to them and seeing how small you are in comparison. The boys loved it! The only thing they were disappointed with is the fact that they couldn't go inside any of them. There are a lot of them and it can be quite a walk, so bring some water if it's a hot day. They have paved sidewalks all throughout, so you can bring strollers or wagons for little ones. We then went inside the museum building where there is a small gift shop and a room with other planes and other things to look at. They had replicas of nuclear bombs which was fascinating to see. It opened up opportunities to talk to my kids about war and the men and women that serve our country and protect our freedom. There is no admission fee to see any of this, but they have places where you can put in donations to help with the upkeep of this attraction. They also have volunteers there to answer any of your questions. Was a fun morning and would highly recommend.",

     "comment": "We took our young grandchildren, ages 4 & 7, to see the museum after our grandson spotted the outdoor plane exhibit from I-15. We started with the two indoor exhibit halls, then went outside to see the planes around the grounds. There were easily more adults there than children, so don't be put off if you're traveling without kids. The museum is free, the gift shop offers a nice selection of airplane-related gifts, and there are bathrooms in the main building. If you're planning to stay a while, especially in the summer, pack cold drinks as there are none sold in the store and the only soda machine outside was out of service. As a bonus, the outdoor area offers a great view of the Wasatch Mountains. Oddly, the elderly museum volunteers were cranky on the day we visited. Overall, we had a good time.",

I made it a point to thank them for their service. There's a small exhibit about the Vietnam military POWs and their experiences...unfortunately the unsupervised, small, noisy children were a distraction...not their fault...\nThe larger aircraft outside give you a very good idea of the sheer size of some of these aircraft.\nAll-in-all it was a good visit.",

There is a 40 minute long children's demonstration with flight simulators, science experiments and even blocks for the littlest ones! The museum in set up nice, interesting information. I watched several short video's at different displays that were nice. The planes outside are HUGE. The one thing we were disappointed in was the \"movie\" in the little theater. It is terrible. It's very short, the into music takes longer than the clips, there are about four clips, and it doesn't hold up to the rest of the museum. Skip it, unless you need to rest your feet.",

The theater shows a pretty crappy movie that is only a few minutes long. I was bored of the place after 20 minutes. I did notice that some kids loved it but I think most are bored within 30 min. It's free so that's a plus. Maybe worth a stop if you're in the area but not a destination. There are a lot of planes and they put effort into the place but its just kinda boring.\nTo be fair, I have never been to an aerospace museum other than this, so perhaps it is relatively good? But I got bored quickly. If it wasn't free, I'd rate it 2 stars.",

     "comment": "The Hill Aerospace Museum is located just to the west of Hill Air Force Base in Ogden UT. It's open five days per week (Tue-Sat) from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm.\nWhile admission is free, they accept donations. The majority of the work restoring the aircraft and manning the information booths is conducted by volunteers. Many of them are USAF veterans who actually flew the aircraft on display; their wealth of knowledge is impressive and their stories make your visit that much more special.\nThe museum has an extensive display of flying gear, dating back to the first aircraft in military service, from US and other military services. There are several sections to the museum. Several of the larger aircraft and missile systems are on permanent display outside the museum. The uniforms are the first display you'll see upon entering the facility. The first large hangar contains exhibits from the Wright Brothers through the Korean War. A walkway containing photos and bios of prominent military aviation pioneers connects you to the modern jet age hangar. Also located in the museum is a learning center, where children can learn about aviation and a classroom, full of carefully crafted model aircraft, for group presentations.\nif you'd like to coordinate a group visit, the museum oftentimes can secure a dedicated guide for your party. The phone number is 801-777-6818. While the guide is normally one of their volunteers, they are also able to secure an active duty Air Force pilot from Hill AFB to lead you through the museum.\nWhile you can walk through the entire facility in about an hour, I recommend allocating at least three hours in order to take in all the exhibits.",

Once you see the size of the Gatling gun cannon that makes the A-10 “Warthog” the worlds best tank killer, I feel for those poor souls who happen to be on the ground when an A-10 comes calling. The SR-71 “Black bird” spy plane is also one of my favorite exhibits. Plan on spending at least a half of a day here to totally explore all of the indoor and outside exhibits.",

Great displays, high quality aircraft-the whole museum is very well thought out and care taken by those who have produced it. It is worth going out of your way to visit the museum-the active Hill AFB is further down the road. Excellent shop.",

     "comment": "I've lived in this area for over 15 years and had never visited this museum until this summer. I must say, I was shocked at the size of the buildings and the amount of planes on display. Everything was very close up and labeled so that you knew what it was. The museum is nicely laid out and there are even mannequins in period costumes around some of the exhibits. The thing I found most interesting, oddly enough, wasn't a plane, it was a display on Vietnam POWs. They had a replica of a cell at the Hanoi Hilton, along with stories of men who'd served at Hill Air Force Base before (or since) being captured in Vietnam. It was a very interesting story and I enjoyed the way that display was set up very much. I'm not sure I'd give this an overly enthusiastic recommendation for children. My daughter (10) was entertained for about an hour, but after that, she was wanting to leave.",

     "comment": "The Hill Aerospace Museum is located on approximately 30 acres on the northwest corner of Hill Air Force Base, about five miles south of Ogden. The museum was founded in 1981 as a part of the United States Air Force Heritage Program and first opened in 1986. It moved to its current facility in 1991.\nThe Museum exhibits more than 90 military aircraft, missiles, and aerospace vehicles on the grounds and inside the Major General Rex A. Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery.\nThe list of aircraft on display is extensive. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, rockets, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.\nWe highly recommend a visit to the museum for aviation enthusiasts, and anyone with an interest in vintage aircraft and the United States Air Force history. It truly is an incredible facility well worth visiting.\nIt is conveniently located just off I-15 at Exit 338, Roy Exit. A gate pass onto Hill AFB is NOT required to visit the museum. Simply take Exit 338 (east) off Interstate 15 in Roy, Utah, and enter the museum grounds through the gate.\nAlso housed in the museum is an extensive, well-stocked gift shop. Food service is not provided onsite.\nParking and admission is free.\nOn our last visit in May of 2013, we spent nearly three hours in the museum. But the exhibits are so extensive and well done, that one could easily spend an entire day, and not see everything.",

Oh, did I mention it was free, with lots of free parking, and also just over the interstate. You can spend the better part of the day here. We happened to be there on a Wednesday when the teaching center for kids was open. OK, so I'm a long way from being a kid but they let me try out the F-16 simulator. Can't say enough about this museum. Highly recommended!",

Most of the displays are in two large air conditioned buildings with a huge number of great volunteers to help you and tell you about each display. I was very impressed with condition of the aircraft as most look like they just came off the factory floor. Be prepared to spend several hours as there is so much to see for adults and children. I will definitely go back and spend time learning about the history of the aircraft. This museum is free and supported by donations and some help from the military.

The museum recently started a dedicated display for the Vietnam conflict to compliment the one that they already have for the Korean war. Both display's are tremendous and offer detail and information that is hard to find, unless you are a war historian. On a personal side, my wife's late grandfather flew bombers in WWII, and was a volunteer guide at this museum for many years. Having him take us through the museum describing his actions and memories with some of these aircraft during his service was incredible. The museum often has volunteers that do this same thing for anyone who comes through. Do your self a favor and ask the front desk about it. You will be glad that you did. I can't recommend this highly enough.",

Staff is clearly not just people who look at this as a job- very passionate.\nI assumed it to be a 15 minutes stop- took about 2 hours instead.",

You will learn a lot about history and come away with a greater respect for the men and women who have served our nation over the years.",

There were always workers nearby that would gladdly help you with any questions that you might have had. You will definatly be able to keep your kids attention with all of the neat planes and information cases. This museum is fun fo all ages and will keep you entertained.",

I loved the old bi-planes and my favorite - the B-17! I think that the boys would have loved to stay longer, but we could only stay for 3 hours before we had to head back. Even then I think we saw more than enough. I think that a few trips would be very worthwhile - especially for anyone who has a love of historical and military aircraft.\nI remember my first visit as a scout, where our scoutmaster took us up to a F-4 Phantom and proceeded to tell us stories of his time flying them in 'Nam'. Our recent experience was led by a volunteer from the airbase who was being deployed the next day. He was an actual pilot and the boys loved to hear him talk of his experiences.\nWe will be back soon",

     "comment": "Going from not flying at all to sending rockets to the moon and beyond has almost all happened during my lifetime. But military aircraft has largely been developed secretely surrounded by mystery, myths of Alliens, and unbelievable achievement. To be able to see examples of this development upclose and touchable is to me more exciting, thrilling, and inspiring than to watch the most are out and futuristic movie about air and space travel. Anything can be done in the movies through models, art work and computers. But what you see at the Hill Air Force Base Museum WE ACTUALLY DID. To see it makes one proud to be a member of the human race. I thank the people at Hill Air Force Base for assembling such a breath-taking array of these aircrafts, and organize and maintain them for us to see that WE REALLY DID IT! (I wonder what unbelievable \"marvels\" are on the drawing boards or evening being flight test as we marvel at what we see at this great museum. If you are even close the it, DON'T MISS IT!",

My daughter (13) and I spent the time downloading photos into my laptop (we've had to do these stops before and, frankly, when you've seen one plane, you've seen them all if you're not interested in them).\nPlanes, planes, planes. I don't know the specific models, but the boys took lots of pictures. There aren't many places for the \"significant others\" to sit and wait. I think they spent about an hour and a half looking at the planes (we knew we were on a tight schedule, so they may have rushed through the museum thinking they might run out of time). The staff/volunteers seemed very knowledgable and even suggested another museum he may like. That was super helpful since I never know what to look for in these things.\nWe decided to wait in a room that was dark (to preserve the artifacts), cool and not as busy. Turned out it was a flight suit exhibit - those were interesting for us to look at.\nAdmission is free (or by donation).",

It has all kinds of retired military airplanes and the guys in our group especially found this place to be really cool :-) When you first walk in the museum seems quite small, but I was pleasantly surprised that there were two huge buildings attached holding the majority of the airplanes and engines. They also have an area sectioned off just for kids where they can try on old military aviation uniforms and sit in simulated cockpits and try their hand at flying. Overall, our whole group really enjoyed it. Even the little ones can roam around a little if you keep an eye on them. My only complaint is that the rooms wih the airplanes were so hot! We were really sweating! Other than that it was great and you can't beat the price, although I'm sure they appreciate donations. Running a museum like that can't be cheap.",

You can do a quick walk around in an hour or spend longer by reading the well done information signs. The outside aircraft are a bit shabby due to weathering, but you can get up close to enjoy and learn about USAF history & planes from WWII to now.",

     "comment": "We live near this museum and I have been taking my children (ages 7 and 5) here regularly for several years. This museum has two large hangars full of airplanes representing the history of flight from the Wright brothers to the F-16. Planes from all of the major wars in the last century are represented. There is also a large yard in front with many more planes to see up close. My grandpa piloted a B-24 in WWII and I like seeing that plane with my kids and sharing their history with them. The volunteers are friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all, there is no charge to enjoy the museum, though donations are gratefully accepted.\nThere is an Education Room in the back hangar where kids can play with science toys. It isn't open all the time, so check in advance if you want to be sure it will be open for your visit. For younger kids there are traditional toys and for older kids (and adults) there are flight simulators and computers. Once last summer a volunteer helped helped us make paper rockets that we then took outside and shot into the air.\nTripadvisor's Ogden address for this attraction threw me off a little. This museum is inside Hill Air Force Base, just west of I-15 near Roy, a smaller city just south of Ogden. You can easily see this museum from the freeway, especially if you are travelling from the south.",

     "comment": "Went here for about an hour while guys went golfing. I do not know much about planes, but was very impressed with this museum. First of all, there was no admission, only donations. There are planes on display outside, then in 2 warehouse like areas inside full of more. Could have easily spent more time here (picnic benches outside under/around planes on a nice day would make for a nice lunch spot;)). If you are I the area or passing by, hope you have time to go and make a donation to this great display.",

     "comment": "I have been to about every airplane museum in America and also in Europe and I rate the Hill AFB museum in the top three. It is free, free parking, right off the Roy exit on I15. I don't get where they say this is Ogden. An amazing array of aircraft that is not just air force. You have replica Wright flyers all the way up to current F-16's with everything in between including a C124 and B24. There are vets or free tour guides to ask any questions and a fun gift shop. Watch the movies and spend the day. There are plenty of eating aces within three to five minutes away. Plan a trip and spend the day.",

     "comment": "The exhibits outside are great. Being able to catch some shade underneath a B-52 bomber is pretty amazing... Be sure and save time for the inside and speak with some of the exhibit volunteers. These folks have an amazing number of years experience and knowledge. The person I spoke with was a former NASA dude who had helped rebuilt/restore part of a B-17 console. Cheers",

     "comment": "This is a tremendous air museum. Warplanes from all air wars are displayed from a Wright brother's replica to a SR-71 Blackbird. Over 50 planes are displayed. Of particular interest is a display of Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo and an in depth movie of the making and history of the SR-71. The displays also include the Utah Air Force Hall of Fame with fascinating stories of heroism. Allow 1 to 2 hours.",

     "comment": "Hill AFB museum is free! Outdoor display included several F-4 Phantoms, B-1B, B-52, plus many others that you can walk up to and touch! Such heroes flew these planes. The indoor museum was HUGE and included an SR-71 (our favorite) plus MANY others. There are also many old fly-boys hanging around to answer your questions....very interesting to talk to them! Great gift shop offering many models, books, t-shirts, kid's toys, all at very reasonable prices....a must-see for a family vacation!",

My husband is a history/military buff & couldn't believe they had several rare planes he had never seen before. It blows away even the Smithsonians collection & the local ones we have in WA & OR. Stop you won't regret it. Oh, & easy on & off the freeway!",

     "comment": "Hill Air Force Base Museum is conveniently located on Interstate 15 about 35 miles north of Salt Lake City. For anyone interested in military aircraft, the Museum displays a very large collection of U.S. Air Force aircraft from about 1940 to 2000.\nThe collection includes famous aircraft from the Cold War period including the B-52, B-47, F-102, F-4, C-124, and many others. The collection includes notable World War II aircraft inculding the B-29, B-24, B-17, P-40, P-51, P-47, and P-38.\nThe large aircraft are displayed outdooors, where they unfortunately show the effects of weather. Smaller and fully-restored aircraft are displayed inside two large air-conditioned buildings where they are well protected but unfortunately parked so close to one another it is sometimes difficult to fully appreciate the aircraft. There are a large number of displays of missles, aircraft engine cut-aways, etc. Admission is free. Access to the Museum is very convenient, because it is adjacent to, but not enclosed in, the active Air Force Base, so there are no difficult admission procedures.\nOne of the most interesting displays focuses on women pilots who served in World War II, mainly ferrying aircraft. I was surprised and saddened to learn that many of these women faced a great deal of hostility from male fliers, mechanics, etc. It is sad that people had time for that pettiness while trying to fight such a major war.",

     "comment": "My husband and I took our 9 year old son here on September 2, 2007 while en route from Brigham City to Salt Lake City. The museum is located by the Hill Air Force base. Our son is very interested in World War II and military aircraft. He very much enjoyed the museum as did myself and my husband!\nThis museum houses dozens of renovated military aircraft, from the Wright Flyer to WWII planes and newer jet fighters such as an F-15 and a Blackbird. There are indoor and outdoor exhibits (the larger planes are located outdoors, such as the B-52 bomber). The complete listing of aircraft is on the museum's website. Outside we also saw aircraft landing at the Air Force base which was cool.\nThere are informative displays about each aircraft and even a small military uniform display. Volunteers are on staff to provide insight about the various aircraft. Since my son appeared very into the museum we were given a very thorough tour of the museum by two volunteers, which we enjoyed very much and found very informative.\nThe museum and parking are free and open 7 days a week. I would definitely recommend this museum to military aircraft and history enthusiasts.",
