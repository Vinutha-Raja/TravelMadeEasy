With this museum being open, affordable, and showing a few pieces from the Smithsonian; I thought it would be a good fit for my family.
3/4 of the art work showed nudity or semi nudity. So having children meant constant giggling or covering of eyes.
I was aware from their website that this museum believes in showing all sorts of art work. But every corner we turned showed more and more nudity work.
So I suggest to go elsewhere if that’s not your thing.","Written September 23, 2020","2","193 contributions"

The third Saturdays also have special craft activities that you can participate in. They are aimed for families and children, but I often enjoy decorating clay plates, making a sculpture, etc as well. The museum staff is very friendly and explains the exhibits that are going on.
UMFA is well-curated, and even though it doesn't have any singular stand alone pieces, it is does have some beautiful works by famous artists such as Renoir and Singer-Sargent. These master works are combined with unique exhibits such as Mayan pottery, Spanish art, and an Egyptian sarcophagus room. It is well worth the low price of admission (especially on aforementioned free days).
Let it be said that I actually like the streamer room. Sure, it could probably be used for a lot more art in the large hall, and it isn't my favorite Feher piece, but it is pretty awesome to have a Feher piece at all. His work is certainly modern contemporary, which many people don't appreciate; that's fine. But he is one of the biggest names in the US of this generation, and the pink streamers are just another example of his simple trademark colorful design. For the people that don't appreciate the neon pink streamers - at least he didn't paint an entire city lot pink here as he did in New York.
There is also a small cafe in the front where you can get cookies, scones, and coffee, which is a great way to end your visit, or hang out while the kids are doing crafts or listening to stories.
The parking is the one thing that leaves more to be desired, but if you go on the weekend there is plenty of free parking since permits aren't enforced.","Written March 21, 2016","1","32 contributions"

Unexpected, because I didn't think that there would be a museum in Salt Lake City with such high quality, and eclectic, collections. Gem, because it was really great.
From what I gather, the collections were largely the work of one person, who collected, and probably funded, the works on display, over a 20 year or so period.
The spaces for each exhibit are thoughtfully done. Some spaces are smaller than others, yet the displays are excellent, each piece well exhibited, and there is no feeling that works are crammed together.
Eclectic, because there is a huge range of exhibits, time periods, cultures. The Oceania Exhibit is small, with each piece of high quality, and some are simply about as good as they get. Ditto for the small exhibit of Buddhist art. The European paintings are excellent.
We planned on spending a couple of hours, and decided that we had to return for another visit. The museum merits minimally 3 hours.
This would be a great place for a kid to come to time and again, for short periods, to gain an understanding of the huge variety of cultures, periods and art, that the world has to offer. But, then, I am recalling my own early experiences, being taken to museums by my parents, where I was first exposed to the amazing variety of eras, cultures and art.
I should add that the staff are all very friendly, and made us feel welcomed.","Written March 11, 2015","0","327 contributions"

It's like the difference between going to a large grocery store and a convenience store. It has many categories of art, and some quality pieces, but just a few works in each section. Because of my poor sense of direction, I usually get lost in museums, but not this one. It's too small to get lost. I kept thinking, oh, that's all??
Many large museums have a children's section with hands on activities. This one didn't have a section like that.
It didn't have any regular daily tours either. And, the gift shop was small. So, as long as your expectations aren't too high, it's worth a couple hours.","Written March 22, 2016","2","8 contributions"

Recently we had wanted to see the exhibit on the Bingham Canyon mine. It was very well done, including works from the museum's collection along with borrowed works from various sources. It piqued an interest in us about the process of curating a special exhibit.
I would suggest that parking could be better marked and explained. The building itself is great with easy access. There is a cafe available, although we did not eat there. We took a quick walk through the gift shop and found it to be very interesting, having some unique items for sale.
In addition to the Bingham mine exhibit, we perused the other works on display from the permanent collection. I agree that Salt Lake can and should have a more extensive art museum, but we are pleased with what we have. From the display of the history of the museum in the cafe it is clear that there are many works in storage that could be displayed were there more space and personnel, for instance it referred to a vast collection of Navajo weavings in the permanent collection. I want to see them! It also mentioned a collection of Chinese porcelain. What is in storage that was NOT mentioned!!!
As far as current displays, it seems rather heavy on South Pacific island works. We found the variety and quality of paintings from American and European artists to be quite broadly represented. The biggest surprise to me was a video performance work. Usually I scoff, since I consider myself somewhat of a provincial...but it actually captivated me as I took time to watch it. So the museum opened my mind to something new on a rainy Saturday. I loved that about it. Well worth the visit.","Written September 29, 2014","0","197 contributions"

I lived in Salt Lake for eight years in the 1980s and concur with the opinion that the visual arts do not receive all that much attention. The permanent collection has a few nice works in several galleries painted in a garish orange that detracts from the paintings. The two special exhibits of note were paintings of the Great Salt Lake and contemporary prints. As an art aficionado, I spent a pleasant enough two hours but will repeat that a major urban center deserves a better art museum. The Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute, Indiana, a city with a metro population of 170,000, has a more impressive permanent collection. This museum certainly doesn't even come close to matching the Toledo Museum of Art in the city where I grew up.","Written December 29, 2013","3","123 contributions"

It is easy to find with signs along the main road. There is limited parking across the street from the museum as well as near the main entrance. Unless there is a football game, I wouldn't expect parking to be much of an issue however. The regular adult price for admission is $7, with discounts for senior citizens and children. Entrance is free for members of the military. However at $7 the museum is still worth it.
The museum is small but still provides an excellent selection of paintings and sculptures. Unlike many art museums in the US, this one actually has quality works by famous artists. You will not find any abstract or ""art done by monkeys"" here. They have temporary exhibits that rotate, but don't know how often.
They have a selection of Native American, US, Pacific Islands, ancient Egypt, Rome, and others in different rooms. While I was there they had a temporary exhibit titled: Bierstadt to Warhol: American Indians in the West, which was one of the better collections of art about the depiction of Native Americans I have seen at a small museum. The Native American There are signs that provide a background of the artist and the themes which help for those of us not familiar with them. There is also a free audio guide available, but didn't use it due to time restrictions.
The museum is open everyday except for Mondays and holidays. This makes it convenient for those looking for something to do on a Sunday. There is also a small cafe and store inside the museum. Photography is allowed throughout as long as you do not use a flash. I would definitely recommend the Utah Museum of Fine Arts.

The quality of paintings and sculptures is low. The exhibits are good for elementary kids who need some art exposure. The curator does have a remedial plan, which is to concentrate on contemporary art. This is a good plan, because there is lots and lots of contemporary art to be found, and nobody knows if it is good or bad until the curator tells them.","Written January 2, 2012","2","90 contributions"
