I love getting to go to museums that have anything to do space and aerospace. While this pales in comparison to other museums size wise, it is still definitely worth a visit. For me this was a trip down memory lane. The aircraft that are indoors are very well preserved and cared for. While there are some items that have displays explaining what the items are, there are some that are not labeled. There is a very descriptive display for our heroes that served in Vietnam. The museum is free to visit although there are plenty of donation boxes around the museum. The staff do not bug you about contributions. The staff are also very friendly and want to help. Like I said, it is definitely worth a visit if you have any interest in aircaraft.","","Written May 21, 2021"

In addition to the planes there are also wheeled vehicles, sample uniforms from days gone by, and stories about famous airmen.
Are also docents around the museum willing to talk to you about any of the exhibits; and extremely knowledgeable.
There are both inside and outside exhibits.
I was there for 3 hours and it seemed like I had been there for about 15 minutes. Dozens of photos and some great memories.

You get very close to the planes. Because of COVID you can't get into the cockpits of the ones that they normally open cockpits for. This is an average museum and in my opinion falls into the ""if you've seen one aerospace museum you've seen them all"" category. It's not much different than other typical plane museums. It is on Hill AFB but you don't go on base. The museum is very clean and kept up very nicely. We made a special trip up that way to see it and it really wasn't worth it because it's just another plane museum. Still, if you live nearby, or in the area and want to find a place to kill a few hours with the kids, this will do it for sure.","36 contributions","Written August 24, 2020"

Then they have a nice number of aircraft outside that you can walk along the sidewalk to see up close. They also have a small gift shop inside. We spent about an hour and a half here and felt that was sufficient. If you just love airplanes and want to read all the display information, you will want more time. As I think back on our visit here, I remember this small boy there with some other men in his family. He just kept saying “Whoa!” as he saw all these large aircraft.

It housed all the jets and planes I read about and watched in movies.
F15 from top gun, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, my favorite plane.
A10 warthog etc etc.
The planes outside before you go inside is crazy too. I made a special trip to Utah and lucked out to see this place.
Go see it see it now.
As a side note there was a gentleman there who I spoke with who told me some amazing war stories again worth the time to talk to the vets.","19 contributions","Written August 28, 2019"

There are planes from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War as well as a small jet used by President Lyndon Johnson painted in the Air Force One colors as well as a an F-16 flown by the Thunderbirds. Almost 100 airplanes are on display in two indoor galleries and an outdoor airpark. Parking is free and admission is free, however there are locked containers throughout the museum to make a donation. The hours of operation are Mon-Sat, 9:00 am - 4:30 pm. They close the gates promptly at 4:30 pm. The museum is staffed by volunteers, many ex-military, who are happy to share information and stories from their time in the service.
Upon entering the museum you can pick up a map of the facility and stop into the small theater that has short films that, run on a continuous loop, on various aspects of the US Air Force. In the museum itself the planes have a narrative on the plane itself as well as some interesting notes. In addition to planes, there are helicopters, military vehicles, a replica of the first atomic bomb detonated, code name Trinity, as well as other decommissioned ordinance. There are also several areas with short videos set up to give a more in-depth experience to the visitor.
Some of the more special planes of interest to me were the C-130 Military Transport Plane, the B-29 Superfortress from World War II and Korean War fame, the B-52 Stratofortress (which is still in use today), the B-1 Bomber (a supersonic heavy bomber), the SR-71 Blackbird a strategic reconnaissance aircraft used primarily for covert aerial reconnaissance and a MiG-21 Russian built supersonic interceptor also used by China, North Vietnam, India, Croatia and Romania.
There is a gift shop by the entrance selling books, tee shirts, jackets, snacks and other souvenir gifts. It takes a good 2 1/2 hours minimum to see everything and read about the history of the planes but if you just want to do a quick walk through you can do it in less time. You cannot touch the planes or sit inside them but you can take as many pictures as you want. If you have any interest in planes utilized by the US Air Force and want to get a good look at many of them, this is definitely a place to visit and as stated before , the price can't be beaten, even with a monetary donation.","346 contributions","Written January 31, 2019"

About 50 are located inside and the balance are located outside. The aircraft included fighters, bombers, helicopters and passenger/cargo aircraft and were either piston or jet engine powered. All the aircraft were military, no civilian passenger planes. Most of the aircraft has been serviced at Hill AFB. In addition to the aircraft, there are a number of drones and missiles.
There was NO charge to tour the Museum. There is a gift shop but no canteen (restaurant) on site.

The Hill museum is much smaller, but everything else is, including the NASA Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.
The Hill museum has an incredible collection, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. There are few ""antique"" planes, but the aircraft are a marvel to see.
If you go, plan on taking at least an hour. If you are a buff, plan on three or four hours and you may have enough time to inspect and appreciate the great aircraft.
One little display, often overlooked is in a small case to the west side of one building. The glass case contains a couple of photos of a man, Vern Moncur, along with his flight jacket. He was a member of the crew called ""Hell's Angels."" No, not a motorcycle gang, but the crew of a B-17 bomber that served in the European theater.
I have been to the museum a few times, but I never have enough time, so I end up returning, only to run out of time on each visit.
If you are an airplane or Air Force buff, no matter what you're looking for, you'll find something that will catch your eye and stop you in your tracks.
This is a great place to visit, to bring your children or grandchildren. It will inspire awe in them if you take the time to tell what these aircraft were, what they were used for, and how they changed the tide of history.","265 contributions","Written October 3, 2018"

I've been to several military museums and this wasn't the best but it was good. I'm glad I went.","195 contributions","Written October 2, 2018"

The museum is on an active Air Force base, so in addition to static displays you may get to watch F-35s fly around during your visit, which we did (I could do that all day....). Like several others mentioned I have visited many aviation museums, and Hill Aerospace Museum makes the cut for those I want to visit several more times. I need several days - a few hours are not enough really. Many docents are on-site and there a lot of activities for children.
The aircraft outside are not restored, but I must say that I like to see these planes in the 'normal' condition they were in when in service and / or recovered. This really gives a perspective on how challenging the conidtions were for the airman and ground crews, and an appreciation of the very hard work needed to restore the aircraft to museum quality.
And admission is free, unlike most of the other better museums, but I still left a nice donation equal to the admission at other museums.","36 contributions","Written September 26, 2018"

This facility is top notch. The buildings are provided by the USAF and most staffing is provided by retired airmen. The hardware has been restored and several of the planes have a connection to Utah flyers and Hill AFB. Two hangers house many planes from the Wright Flyer replica to the SR71 Blackbird. Posters do a good job of describing the displays and give some of the historic events that these planes were involved in. Talking to some of these volunteers brings back memories of my time in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). I flew as a passenger is a few of these planes and seen many of them on radar screens. Exiting the buildings there is a static display of several of the larger planes including a B1B, B52 and a C119 Flying Boxcar which I had flew in back in 1963.

But if you stop in you'll be treated to a terrific display of military aircraft spread over a large outdoor exhibit and two enclosed galleries. An aerospace museum on an Air Force base is a formula for success and the Hill museum does not disappoint. Outside you can walk around a collection of mostly larger planes that includes many of the usual suspects as well as some lesser known models, such as the C-119 Flying Boxcar and the Bomarc missile; maybe the most elegantly designed weapon of the Cold War era and rarely seen at museums. The two large enclosed galleries start with a couple of early aviation replicas then move you directly to WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and a variety of Cold War era planes. Except for a few informational panels WWI is not represented. Don't expect to see other allies represented here. This is almost exclusively a history of U.S. military aviation with just a couple of foreign aircraft thrown in. In addition to the planes, a variety of other artifacts are salted throughout the exhibits with nice displays and good historical text. The Hill museum does a really nice job of personalizing the experience by tying some of the aircraft to notable Utah aviators. A staff of friendly, talkative, and knowledgeable volunteers will gladly answer your questions or share their stories. While not on par with the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, this is one of, if not the best, pure military air museum west of the Mississippi. I know aviation museums aren't for everyone, but if you're into planes, or military history in general; this is worth a visit. Little boys will love it. By the way, admission is FREE.","80 contributions","Written May 13, 2017"

Some of these are rare and difficult to find in other places short of the Smithsonian or Wright-Patterson. Among the WWII aircraft on display are a B 25 Mitchell , Republic P 47 thunderbolt (aka jug), Consolidated B 24 Liberator, and Lockheed P-38 lightning, and a B 29 superfortress, - newer aircraft include a Convair F 106 Delta Dart, a Lockheed F 104 Starfighter, Boeing B 47 Stratojet, (wish they had a B58 hustler), Lockheed-Martin SR 71 Blackbird, Boeing B 1 Lancer and a Douglas C 124 Globemaster. the only complaint (and it's minor) is that despite being housed in two buildings and outside static displays they are somewhat crowded inside. Perhaps the best thing about it is that as you head north on interstate 1 - 15 it's an easy off and on.

This excellent museum hits both extremes. Viewing all these amazing planes in an almost ideal setting (more on that later), is a testimony to the amazing inventors, engineers, fabricators, and of course, pilots. Learning about airplanes as weapons (e.g., gunnery capable of thousands of rounds per minute), battle details (excellent timeline of Korean ""conflict"") and collateral damage (a history of the Hanoi Hilton) was a very very harsh history lesson. And then there are the B bombers in the outdoor boneyard, each capable of delivering incalculable payloads. All in all, an amazing experience, although hardly a sugar-coated inducement to enlist.
My only wish was that there was better viewing access to at least some planes. There are almost no elevated up-close viewing platforms, and none could be entered. I would loved to be able to sit on the flight deck, touch the controls and let my imagination take over.","60 contributions","Written March 2, 2017"

We are so glad that we did. The displays were amazing! My kids, ages 7-15, were all engaged with the planes, helicopters, and stories for almost 2 hours. I loved reading about the Doolittle Raiders and seeing the replica of the aircraft carrier. It was a bit chilly so we did not get to spend as much time with the displays outside as we wanted. We had the opportunity to visit with two Vietnam Veterans volunteering there. They were so happy to visit with us about flying helicopters and differences between the choppers and planes. We will be back next time we are through Ogden.","68 contributions","Written January 11, 2017"

Not everything is in pristine shape, such as the forlorn little O-2 FAC aircraft wedged in as an afterthought in the Fighter Hangar. One thing they need is a snack bar or mini-cafe.

I was staying at a hotel in downtown SLC. To go back to the city, I had to drive 15 minutes from the island to a town called Layton. From there, I would get on I-15 going south to SLC. Hill Museum is in Roy which is 5 minutes drive in the other direction on I-15 North.
I am not an airplane buff, but I still can appreciate the value of this place with its sheer size and the vast number of airplanes -- there are 2 hangars each with about 20+ airplanes, then an outdoor park with about another 20+ airplanes. I also really enjoyed the notes on the placards that explained the historical background associated with each airplane and the details of the wars those planes flew in. I spent about 2 hours there..
In short, if you have a special interest in military history or airplanes, then it's a must visit place. If you are just an average person, then it's a nice add-on excursion if you go to Antelope Island to visit the Great Salt Lake, which by the way is a must-visit if you like nature and the outdoors.","39 contributions","Written July 28, 2016"

No admission charge, no parking fee. And you start seeing aircraft as soon as you turn onto the property - the outdoor display lines the road to the parking lot. The museum tells the story of military aviation in Utah and how it relates in particular to Hill AFB. It shares a freeway exit with the truck gate to Hill, so pay attention to directional signs. (Don't worry; if you arrive at the gate to Hill, they will politely turn you around rather than shoot you). They cram a remarkable number of large aircraft into two relatively small indoor halls. The really big planes (including a B-52) are located outside. While not as well interpreted (or funded, for that matter) as the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian or the museum at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, the volunteers are every bit as knowledgeable, informative, and helpful. This is well worth your time if you find yourself in the area. The museum is an easy 30-minute drive north from Salt Lake City or just minutes south from downtown Ogden.","285 contributions","Written July 3, 2016"

Easy to get to and easy to get back on the road. The first thing you notice is the large number of historic aircraft parked outside. It could take you an hour just to walk through and examine them in detail, and yes, you can walk up to them and touch. Unfortunately, you can't get inside them. I was surprised to see that since my last visit, they have added a B-52 and a B-1. Just the B-52 was a thrill to see and stare at!
Then enter the museum itself. The small foyer will not prepare you for the two large hangars full of aircraft. WW1, WW2, Korea, Viet Nam, and Gulf War planes are in there, along with more prosaic aircraft. You (and particularly your children) will love it. And will get sore feet from walking around. A theater constantly runs very enlightening movies about various aircraft. Even the gift shop is a joy to visit.

The Hill AFB Museum is 30 acres with two major hanger areas and outside exhibits with over 90 aircraft and missiles, easily accessible off I-15 without having to enter restricted Hill AFB. Aircraft start in time with a Wright Brothers replica, mainly skip WWI, but have most of the famous fighters and bombers starting with WWII and progressing to the B1 Lancer and SR 71 Blackbird. For history buffs, there are plenty of plaques to read describing each aircraft, as well as videos and other displays of wartime history.

The second you see this place, you know you are in for a treat! From the F4 Phantom to the Douglas C-124C Globemaster II which dominates the area and building, the planes represented here are well preserved and still bear original markings and have detailed plaques explaining their place in history.
My favorite plane is the B-29 Superfortress and its older sibling, the B-52. The B-29 on display here flew the weather reconnaissance mission over Japan in advance of the twin B-29s waiting over the Pacific ocean with their deadly and war-ending payloads of atomic bombs. Just to be able to touch this piece of American history is amazing. To know that this plane was so significant in ending the Pacific theatre is beyond phenomenal. And to some it may just be an old plane but I am a die hard fan,
There is a current F-16 Falcon on display along with Korean and Vietnam era flying machines in all their glory. Add in a few personal trainers and some ramjet missiles and other types of support equipment and you have a great place to visit.
The best part is that the outdoor exhibit is 100% FREE!! You can drive in, park, and start to wonder to your heart's content.
The museum is an equally attractive event and chronicles how the nearby Hill AFB got its name plus it house even more planes along with weapons and mechanics of the associated planes. Almost every inch of the building is alive with history from the aviation's infancy to its modern day power punch of firepower. Currently, it is sad to see that America has all of this firepower but has declined to use it more expeditiously with current events. But I am waxing poetic here folks.
Sit down and watch a film, read the walls and boards of those who have made history and just enjoy yourself.
Great place for kids because the outside displays are all open with no fences to bar you from getting up close. Just avoid hanging on the propellers.
The volunteer staff has done an amazing job of keeping the grounds clean and attractive and have tried their best to keep the pigeons at bay. Some of the planes are in need of some repair but they recently underwent painting and overhauls and are a joy to look at.
Bring a sun hat, plenty of water and a stroller for the younger ones and hang out in one of the best displays of American Aviation history in the region.
And if you are lucky, you will catch glimpses of F-22 Raptors, F-16 Falcons, F-15 Eagles, C-130 transports and more taking off from Hill AFB right behind the museum. There are even the occasional A-10 Warthogs and even the rarer B-1 Lancer. The newest attraction at Hill are the new F-35 Lightings but they are rarer still but they are there and take to sky. My personal favorite is the F-22 Raptor.
Have fun and enjoy yourself.","60 contributions","Written March 26, 2016"

The collection of airplanes is astounding and best of all, they have an SR-71. This top secret aircraft is the ultimate in every aspect. Cool looking, amazing speed and fascinating history, it's THE plane to see and Hill has one!
One of the things I love is how you get a real sense of scale. We see planes flying above so often we forget that these amazing machines are really large and incredible feats of engineering. Being able to walk around, under and touch the aircraft gives you a great new perspective.
My only wish is that they would open up at least one aircraft and allow people to sit walk around inside and sit in the cockpit. It would definitely enhance the experience of the visit and make the visit very special. However, it's still a great place to visit and I encourage anyone in the Ogden area to allot a couple hours to see this fun museum.","78 contributions","Written February 17, 2016"

Dramatic growth and improvement since the last time we were hear many years ago. The displays and signage in the main building are some of the best we've seen anywhere. Love the variety of aircraft and other related displays. Lots on Medal of Honor winners and other prominent veterans and significant people in Utah and Hill Air Farce Base history. Excellent Vietnam prisoner of war area and exhibit. Helps put the Hanoi Hilton and prisoner experience into perspective for those who do not know about it. Second building and outside are well done and improving, still adding additional areas. Loved the time spent here. Still could only really read and spend time with a fraction of the things here.

Lots of war memorabilia inside, a movie that we didn't see (no posted show times), and many signs to inform. My husband and his father, a Navy veteran, especially enjoyed the fighter jet gallery. Our 5-, 3-, and 1-year-olds enjoyed the coloring station, manned by a volunteer who had a long chat with my father-in-law about the mission of the museum.
Overall, it felt dated. I sense that we were not the target audience, as there were not hands-on activities for children nor docents, though I saw plenty of volunteers around. Volunteers did make us directly aware of a demonstration that would be happening (of a generator, maybe?), but we were on our way out the door.

A variety of planes are set on the field outside of the museum so you can sense the size as you walk around them . A pamphlet describing the planes is available at the door. Inside the free museum, volunteer Air Force vets will share the stories of the planes they flew. You will see neat rows of planes lined up, video historical footage of plane battles, displays and narratives explaining the start of the wars, use of the planes, etc. A narrative of both the Korean and Viet Nam War is also on display, a great history lesson for both adults and kids. You can view the size of POW cells and number of pilots captured, tortured and murdered during the Viet Nam War. View first hand the short-hand tapping for communication between POW'S. You don't have to be an airplane buff to enjoy this museum. You are able to see the progress in design and
technology in each generation of planes. Also on display, pilots uniforms and flight suits of different time periods. There is also a Museum Gift Shop on site.","40 contributions","Written September 1, 2015"

It is free (donation of $1/person suggested), and they close strictly at 4:30 for security reasons (the adjacent base closes at 4:30 sharp to civilians). You walk in, and it looks pretty unassuming, but then there are two HUGE hangars connected by a hallway with several dozen retired aircraft nicely laid out. The descriptions alongside each aircraft are excellent, as well, and I learned a lot in an hour. The sheer size of the airplanes and helicopters is a real wow factor for our two children (10 and 12), and I couldn't believe it was basically free to visit.

There are two indoor exhibit halls, one mostly early aviation to WWII, then the next building Korea, Vietnam, and miscellaneous.
I found the WWII exhibits very interesting and informative not only on major items, but lesser known aspects of the conflict. I had not known that US soil (Alaska, TH) had been bombed. I knew about the fire/bomb balloons, but not that there were that many.
I think there are 20 aircraft outside. I did not have time to check it out.
As I said in the title, two days wold be needed to really take it all in. I guess I would suggest the early aviation to WWII building, then a break and look outside. Go home and think about it, then on the next visit, look at what you wanted to see more of, then go on to the next building, and spend more time outside.

We then went to the theater in the museum and watched some of the very good aviation documentary movies there.
Then, we went to see the museum. From the outside it doe not look as large as it is. There is also very good information on the different Wars such as Korea and Vietnam, including a display on a POW prison.
On the day we were there they were also setting up for a military presentation of medals to some military people (we saw the military men and women arriving for the presentation.)
There is also a hall of fame display with excellent write ups and pictures.

There are two galleries inside, and larger aircraft are stored outside. A few aircraft can't be seen in many other places, such as the SR-71 Blackbird. There are also replicas and casings of various bombs and rockets, to include a replica of the first atomic bomb.
There is also a lot of factual information on a number of people who played a significant part in either the development of aviation in Utah and/or Hill AFB, or were in the service from the state. Small alcoves showcases the POW experience in Vietnam and the WWII WASPs.
There are a number of audio-visual displays, explaining various aspects of Hill AFB, the Vietnam conflict, and aviation in general.
Admission if free, although a modest donation is suggested.
The only real shame is that they don't have indoor space for the aircraft currently displayed outside - the weather is giving the planes quite a beating.

Great effort has been given by all the volunteers who restored the aircraft and other displays, and accurate information is provided for everything in the museum. For those who wish a hands-on esperience, there are dozens of historic aircraft outside the building.

The aircraft in the outdoor display are all in bad condition, rusting away, with barely any explanatory material. Maybe one sign with the aircraft name on every other one.
The aircraft inside are better preserved but also hardly any information is supplied (although more than outside).
If you're looking for a very educational visit - this is not the place.","381 contributions","Written March 14, 2015"

Getting there can be confusing, as although the museum is only 30 seconds off the freeway, it is on Airforce property and is surrounded by a tall fence, however you don't travel through the base to get to it (turn left when you see the checkpoint at the Roy gate). There is a lot of room for kids to run around at the museum, with actual military planes (not replicas or models) parked in both outdoor as well as indoor galleries. They even have benches and picnic tables under the wings of some planes, so it is a great place to relax and learn about military history. I particularly enjoy the museum because the open nature of the exhibits allows adults and interested kids to read the signs near the planes and munitions while still keeping an eye on the more energetic companions who rush to see the next plane or helicopter. While outside you'll likely notice in-service military planes (fighter-jets as well as cargo and surveillance planes) flying overhead to and from the adjoining Hill Airforce Base.","16 contributions","Written March 6, 2015"

We got lost getting there - must have tried every entrance to Hill A.F.B. before finally finding the right one! It was close to closing time by the time we finally found it so we had to rush. My husband wanted to see the SR71, so he rushed in to see it and I limped along more slowly and found a handy place to sit down, then another handy place, then another. I didn't see nearly as much as I would have liked - I really enjoyed it the other time I was there and I hope we get back again soon when I'm not so tired. Once again my husband was thrilled with the place, even though our time was so limited. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was very clean - even just minutes before closing time! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning the history of the Air Force and flying. It's a great place - but check out how to get there ahead of time - and when they say they close at 4:30 they mean they LOCK the GATES at 4:30 so you'd better be gone by then!","85 contributions","Written February 21, 2015"

Once or twice a year they have events where you (or your grandkids) can sit in the cockpits of some of the planes. Busy days, but worth it.
The museum itself is in two parts; an outdoor area where the *really* big planes are, and the indoor area, which is mainly fighters and helicopters. I recommend you try to go during the spring/summer, when the weather is nice enough to wander outside.

It has indoor displays and outdoor displays.
The building you enter houses the gift shop, uniform display and theater and the building is connected to the first indoor airplane display and that building is connected to another indoor airplane gallery. The walkway between the two indoor galleries showcases the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame. Each airplane has a “fact sheet” type of posting that shows the name, manufacture, engine size, range, etc. as well as its history.
I went with my history/military buff pilot husband and he loved it. He said he saw a couple of airplanes he had never seen in other well known air museums. Some exhibits make you deeply appreciate those airmen and airwomen who fought for their (and our) lives while confined for hours in tight and awfully uncomfortable looking seats as well as the ground/support crews that provided infallible workmanship.
We saw some families with smaller children and the little guys are all happy and in awe with the exhibits. Speaking of families, there is an outdoor picnic area you can drink and eat while watching airplanes. You can’t bring food or drink inside but it’s ok to eat/drink outside and there was a beverage vending machine.

Being an ex-pilot and the son of a military pilot, planes have been an interest all my life. And this museum really touched a chord. It has them all, from some obscure models to the latest in military examples of planes that have been our protectors. They have transporters, fighters, bombers, drones, helicopters, antiques, and even a lot of displays which show what pilots wore, how they were housed in the various conflicts that our country has been involved in. An incredible indoor array, and an awesome walkway with some of the more gigantic of the planes that have flown for us. And we had three of my great-grandchildren with us, and they even enjoyed all those planes... Come see if you're in Utah, it's awesome...","102 contributions","Written August 30, 2014"

Some were so huge and it was crazy to be standing right next to them and seeing how small you are in comparison. The boys loved it! The only thing they were disappointed with is the fact that they couldn't go inside any of them. There are a lot of them and it can be quite a walk, so bring some water if it's a hot day. They have paved sidewalks all throughout, so you can bring strollers or wagons for little ones. We then went inside the museum building where there is a small gift shop and a room with other planes and other things to look at. They had replicas of nuclear bombs which was fascinating to see. It opened up opportunities to talk to my kids about war and the men and women that serve our country and protect our freedom. There is no admission fee to see any of this, but they have places where you can put in donations to help with the upkeep of this attraction.

The museum is free, the gift shop offers a nice selection of airplane-related gifts, and there are bathrooms in the main building. If you're planning to stay a while, especially in the summer, pack cold drinks as there are none sold in the store and the only soda machine outside was out of service.

It's open five days per week (Tue-Sat) from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm.
While admission is free, they accept donations. The majority of the work restoring the aircraft and manning the information booths is conducted by volunteers. Many of them are USAF veterans who actually flew the aircraft on display; their wealth of knowledge is impressive and their stories make your visit that much more special.
The museum has an extensive display of flying gear, dating back to the first aircraft in military service, from US and other military services. There are several sections to the museum. Several of the larger aircraft and missile systems are on permanent display outside the museum. The uniforms are the first display you'll see upon entering the facility. The first large hangar contains exhibits from the Wright Brothers through the Korean War. A walkway containing photos and bios of prominent military aviation pioneers connects you to the modern jet age hangar. Also located in the museum is a learning center, where children can learn about aviation and a classroom, full of carefully crafted model aircraft, for group presentations.
if you'd like to coordinate a group visit, the museum oftentimes can secure a dedicated guide for your party. The phone number is 801-777-6818. While the guide is normally one of their volunteers, they are also able to secure an active duty Air Force pilot from Hill AFB to lead you through the museum.
While you can walk through the entire facility in about an hour, I recommend allocating at least three hours in order to take in all the exhibits.","30 contributions","Written November 26, 2013"

The museum is nicely laid out and there are even mannequins in period costumes around some of the exhibits. The thing I found most interesting, oddly enough, wasn't a plane, it was a display on Vietnam POWs. They had a replica of a cell at the Hanoi Hilton, along with stories of men who'd served at Hill Air Force Base before (or since) being captured in Vietnam. It was a very interesting story and I enjoyed the way that display was set up very much. I'm not sure I'd give this an overly enthusiastic recommendation for children.

The museum was founded in 1981 as a part of the United States Air Force Heritage Program and first opened in 1986. It moved to its current facility in 1991.
The Museum exhibits more than 90 military aircraft, missiles, and aerospace vehicles on the grounds and inside the Major General Rex A. Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery.
The list of aircraft on display is extensive. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, rockets, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.
We highly recommend a visit to the museum for aviation enthusiasts, and anyone with an interest in vintage aircraft and the United States Air Force history. It truly is an incredible facility well worth visiting.
It is conveniently located just off I-15 at Exit 338, Roy Exit. A gate pass onto Hill AFB is NOT required to visit the museum. Simply take Exit 338 (east) off Interstate 15 in Roy, Utah, and enter the museum grounds through the gate.
Also housed in the museum is an extensive, well-stocked gift shop. Food service is not provided onsite.
Parking and admission is free.
On our last visit in May of 2013, we spent nearly three hours in the museum. But the exhibits are so extensive and well done, that one could easily spend an entire day, and not see everything.","","Written October 15, 2013"

The volunteers are all retired airmen who have loads of personal stories about the aircraft and about their service. The kids especially love being able to get in the cockpit and see the controls! When my grandchildren are old enough, I'll take them too!","10 contributions","Written July 29, 2013"

The museum has more than 90 military aircraft, missiles, and aerospace vehicles on the grounds and inside the Major General Rex A. Hadley Gallery and the Lindquist Stewart Fighter Gallery. The collection also includes a wide variety of ordnance and munitions, an assortment of aerospace ground equipment, military vehicles, uniforms, and thousands of other historical artifacts.
The very well stocked gift shop is part of the facility but no food services are present. An excellent all-round museum, focusing of USAF aircraft but very much a top museum in every respect.","2,460 contributions","Written July 25, 2013"

The variety and volume of aircraft that they have is somewhat surprising considering where this facility is located. The museum recently started a dedicated display for the Vietnam conflict to compliment the one that they already have for the Korean war. Both display's are tremendous and offer detail and information that is hard to find, unless you are a war historian. On a personal side, my wife's late grandfather flew bombers in WWII, and was a volunteer guide at this museum for many years. Having him take us through the museum describing his actions and memories with some of these aircraft during his service was incredible. The museum often has volunteers that do this same thing for anyone who comes through. Do your self a favor and ask the front desk about it. You will be glad that you did. I can't recommend this highly enough.","212 contributions","Written July 19, 2013"

The museum displays an array of aircraft spanning the history of Air Force, from its origins as the Army Air Corps in WWII to the present, from a B17 to a SR71Blackbird, one of the few on display anywhere.
In addition to planes, there are a number of informative exhibits featuring period specific uniforms and other information about the history of aviation.

From the bombers and jets outside, to the fantastic items inside. I loved the old bi-planes and my favorite - the B-17! I think that the boys would have loved to stay longer, but we could only stay for 3 hours before we had to head back. Even then I think we saw more than enough. I think that a few trips would be very worthwhile - especially for anyone who has a love of historical and military aircraft.
I remember my first visit as a scout, where our scoutmaster took us up to a F-4 Phantom and proceeded to tell us stories of his time flying them in 'Nam'. Our recent experience was led by a volunteer from the airbase who was being deployed the next day. He was an actual pilot and the boys loved to hear him talk of his experiences.

This stop on our trip was completely for him (16). And he and my hubby loved it. My daughter (13) and I spent the time downloading photos into my laptop (we've had to do these stops before and, frankly, when you've seen one plane, you've seen them all if you're not interested in them).
Planes, planes, planes. I don't know the specific models, but the boys took lots of pictures. There aren't many places for the ""significant others"" to sit and wait. I think they spent about an hour and a half looking at the planes (we knew we were on a tight schedule, so they may have rushed through the museum thinking they might run out of time). The staff/volunteers seemed very knowledgable and even suggested another museum he may like. That was super helpful since I never know what to look for in these things.
We decided to wait in a room that was dark (to preserve the artifacts), cool and not as busy. Turned out it was a flight suit exhibit - those were interesting for us to look at.

They also have an area sectioned off just for kids where they can try on old military aviation uniforms and sit in simulated cockpits and try their hand at flying. Overall, our whole group really enjoyed it. Even the little ones can roam around a little if you keep an eye on them. My only complaint is that the rooms wih the airplanes were so hot!

Indoors there are two buildings linked - the first one features a few pre WW2 aircraft, but the bulk of the exhibits are WW2 plus Korean War planes - they tend to get in each others way, however, especially when it comes to photography - hard to get a clean shot of one aircraft - definate need for additional hanger space to be able to exhibit the collection better
The second building houses the more contemporary aircraft - somewhat better organized, but still crowded - there are some great exhibits, and I could see that they were working on more as I wandered around.
In general this is one of the better aircraft collections and well worth a visit - it also demonstrates a need for additional funding so that more buildings can be put in place so that the collection can be exhibited in a better way, and as I said, the outdoor collection needs a lick of paint.","304 contributions","Written May 13, 2012"

This museum has two large hangars full of airplanes representing the history of flight from the Wright brothers to the F-16. Planes from all of the major wars in the last century are represented. There is also a large yard in front with many more planes to see up close. My grandpa piloted a B-24 in WWII and I like seeing that plane with my kids and sharing their history with them. The volunteers are friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all, there is no charge to enjoy the museum, though donations are gratefully accepted.
There is an Education Room in the back hangar where kids can play with science toys. It isn't open all the time, so check in advance if you want to be sure it will be open for your visit. For younger kids there are traditional toys and for older kids (and adults) there are flight simulators and computers. Once last summer a volunteer helped helped us make paper rockets that we then took outside and shot into the air.
Tripadvisor's Ogden address for this attraction threw me off a little. This museum is inside Hill Air Force Base, just west of I-15 near Roy, a smaller city just south of Ogden.

Being able to catch some shade underneath a B-52 bomber is pretty amazing... Be sure and save time for the inside and speak with some of the exhibit volunteers. These folks have an amazing number of years experience and knowledge. The person I spoke with was a former NASA dude who had helped rebuilt/restore part of a B-17 console.

Warplanes from all air wars are displayed from a Wright brother's replica to a SR-71 Blackbird. Over 50 planes are displayed. Of particular interest is a display of Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo and an in depth movie of the making and history of the SR-71. The displays also include the Utah Air Force Hall of Fame with fascinating stories of heroism. Allow 1 to 2 hours.","166 contributions","Written July 31, 2010"

Outdoor display included several F-4 Phantoms, B-1B, B-52, plus many others that you can walk up to and touch! Such heroes flew these planes.

They have a huge selection of plans both inside & outside. My husband is a history/military buff & couldn't believe they had several rare planes he had never seen before. It blows away even the Smithsonians collection & the local ones we have in WA & OR. Stop you won't regret it. Oh, & easy on & off the freeway!","137 contributions","Written June 30, 2009"

For anyone interested in military aircraft, the Museum displays a very large collection of U.S. Air Force aircraft from about 1940 to 2000.
The collection includes famous aircraft from the Cold War period including the B-52, B-47, F-102, F-4, C-124, and many others. The collection includes notable World War II aircraft inculding the B-29, B-24, B-17, P-40, P-51, P-47, and P-38.
The large aircraft are displayed outdooors, where they unfortunately show the effects of weather. Smaller and fully-restored aircraft are displayed inside two large air-conditioned buildings where they are well protected but unfortunately parked so close to one another it is sometimes difficult to fully appreciate the aircraft. There are a large number of displays of missles, aircraft engine cut-aways, etc. Admission is free. Access to the Museum is very convenient, because it is adjacent to, but not enclosed in, the active Air Force Base, so there are no difficult admission procedures.
One of the most interesting displays focuses on women pilots who served in World War II, mainly ferrying aircraft. I was surprised and saddened to learn that many of these women faced a great deal of hostility from male fliers, mechanics, etc. It is sad that people had time for that pettiness while trying to fight such a major war.","677 contributions","Written June 27, 2008"

The museum is located by the Hill Air Force base. Our son is very interested in World War II and military aircraft. He very much enjoyed the museum as did myself and my husband!
This museum houses dozens of renovated military aircraft, from the Wright Flyer to WWII planes and newer jet fighters such as an F-15 and a Blackbird. There are indoor and outdoor exhibits (the larger planes are located outdoors, such as the B-52 bomber). The complete listing of aircraft is on the museum's website. Outside we also saw aircraft landing at the Air Force base which was cool.
There are informative displays about each aircraft and even a small military uniform display. Volunteers are on staff to provide insight about the various aircraft. Since my son appeared very into the museum we were given a very thorough tour of the museum by two volunteers, which we enjoyed very much and found very informative.
The museum and parking are free and open 7 days a week. I would definitely recommend this museum to military aircraft and history enthusiasts.","135 contributions","Written September 9, 2007"
