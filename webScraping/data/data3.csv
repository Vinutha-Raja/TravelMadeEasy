Hey, twice in my life I've looked at a natural wonder and thought, ""This CAN'T be real. I must be on another planet."" The first was the Grand Canyon. The second? Bryce Canyon National Park.

We spent a day and half in Bryce Canyon and we spent another day at Kolob Canyon - both were spectacular! There were many different cliffs and hoodoos that were simply majestic. The scenic overlooks and hiking trails were well marked making it easy to get through the park. There are plenty of trail options from easy to strenuous. We went at the end of October so the crowds were very manageable - still plenty of people but not anything that hindered our plans. The only negative to our visit was the very rude and unhelpful park ranger at the visitor center."

I think we did a pretty good job planning it out. We got started about sunrise, but there were clouds in the sky. So rather than go directly to Sunset Point, we drove the long road out to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points, stopping at some of the overlooks along the way. The views were very nice, but my favorite was the Natural Bridge Overlook, which featured a beautiful natural bridge so close we could almost touch it. Once we arrived at Rainbow Point, we spent about a half hour just walking along the edge looking down into an amphitheater I've never seen before. It is not quite as spectacular as the main Bryce Amphitheater, but it was vast and it was beautiful, and I've wanted to come here for many years. It also had a lot more ""green"" in it. We proceeded to hike the Bristlecone Loop Trail, which included Yovimpa overlook. This was a fairly easy and enjoyable hike. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the bristlecones have seen better days. I definitely recommend this hike. It helped me to feel like I'd seen the ""entire"" park, rather than just the front-end like most visitors.
We then drove back to the Sunset Point, stopping briefly at Inspiration Point for some good views of the main amphitheater. The colors were stunning by now as the sun had emerged from the clouds and we had a perfect side view of the valley. Upon arriving at Sunset Point, we hiked up to the rim and then completed a very nice loop trail that went down into the canyon. We started by following the Rim Trail from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point. We then hiked down along the Queens Garden Trail. The trail was a bit steep, but high quality and not too crowded. At this point I realized the reviews were correct in noting that the best views in Bryce are from beneath the rim. Magnificent! Truly marvelous! Once we reached the junction with the Navajo Loop Trail, we turned and hiked up to the rim. Wall Street is closed this time of year, but the Navajo Trail was still great. I must admit, it was a bit steep, but the views were so beautiful that the steepness was hardly noticeable. We saw the Two Towers and Thor's Hammer and we noted all the pine trees along the trail that somehow get enough sunlight to grow tall.
Overall, Bryce is an amazing park. I would definitely recommend coming here in late October and/or early November like we did as the weather was cool, the crowds were virtually non-existent, and the little dabs of snow here and there spiced things up a bit."

The crumbling rocks stand tenaciously, and the wrinkles washed out by wind and rain seem to tell the vicissitudes of ages. Against the background of the blue sky and white clouds, the ochre-colored rocks are just beautiful. So far so good. We decided to take the Two Bridges from Sunset Point first. Although the trail was short, the switchbacks on the steep hill trigger my unrecovered thigh soreness from Angels Landing climb. After a short break at noon, I went to the Queens Garden from Sunrise Point. Unexpectedly, the weather changed suddenly on the way, the temperature dropped very quickly, and the snow started to drift. I temporarily changed the plan and went through the loop from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point. Finding Victoria Queen hoodoo in the wind and snow, walking through the various stone forests, is also a different experience. There were only few cars left when we returned to the once crowded parking lot. Next morning we came to Sunrise Point to watch the sunrise, the warm morning light illuminates the stone forest making them looks translucent.
The local Indian tribe is Navajo. According to their legend, Coyote will petrify people with bad deed into sculptures here."

Bryce is so different from all the other parks and is truly amazing.
We were touring Utah in early October and only had one day to see the park. We are not big hikers, so we were just planning to drive to the pullouts and see the easy viewpoints. We thought because of the weather it was going to be a total wash out. To our surprise, we were still able to see the incredible hoodoos from most of the viewpoints. Scenery past the hoodoos in the distance was pretty foggy, but it made for some interesting pictures! What saved our visit was the fact that you can see so much of the park right from the pullouts, without any major hikes.
All of the pullouts are on the left, so definitely drive to the end first, and visit the viewpoints going back. We were especially impressed with Inspiration Point. That was our choice for the best sunrise viewpoint. Oh well, maybe next time! Natural Bridge was another favorite, it was stunning, especially with the fall colors. And it is a very short walk to see the view. Also make a point to see Fairyland Point. It is actually outside the entrance, and is easily missed. It is not mentioned much, but it has a very impressive view of the hoodoos and photographs well.
Pay attention to the temperature forecasts, because Bryce is much colder than surrounding areas because of its elevation at 7000 to 9000 feet. In the early morning in October it was in the low 40’s. Stay hydrated too, to avoid altitude sickness, especially if hiking.
We were so impressed with Bryce Canyon, even in the rain, so we will try it again the next time we are in Utah, and look forward to tackling some of the easier hikes."

The views are as amazing as every picture you have ever seen. How was the spectacular canyon and it's hoodoos formed? - The natural forces of weathering and erosion, from ice and rain created Bryce Canyon. What once was a plateau, the rocks ha e broken down, and eventually became the incredible individual hoodoos.
We love to travel in the Fall to avoid the massive crowds and the extreme temperatures of summer. In late October the weather (mid 50°) was perfect for sightseeing and hiking. We were able to get 8 to 12 miles of hiking on each day of our two day visit, on the wonderfully maintained park trails. The views from Sunset, Sunrise, Inspiration, and Bryce Point were all amazing, but the real adventure is experiencing it from inside the canyon! We can't wait to return!
Only a few small negatives! Too few bathroom facilities, next to no food options, and a lot of the park signage needs refreshing."

We drove out to Rainbow Point ( the second to last point), which had stunning views. It was hard to find parking here but well worth the effort. We then drove back towards the entrance, hitting many of the scenic view points along the way back. There was a food truck at one of them so we were able to do a quick picnic lunch before starting a hike. Many of the popular hiking trails start at Sunset and Sunrise Point so parking in those areas was also difficult. We ended up parking at the Bryce lodge's visitor parking, which is located between the two points. It was a quick walk to the Sunset/Sunrise path from there. That path alone has stunning views, but from there we connected to the Navajo Loop trail. We started by hiking down to Wall Street and then doing Two Bridges on the way back up. If you have limited time to hike Wall Street is definitely the area you want to see.

Very very disappointed in the Bryce Ntl Park Staff and their employees."

But even if you come here just to enjoy the views, you should budget about 4 hours to drive through the park and stop at the many viewpoints.
Virtually everything in Bryce that cries out for a photograph is situated to the east of the park road, so it's easy to find great panoramic shots, great shots where the rocks are bathed in light or muted by shadows, but you will have only a few chances to film light and shadow in tandem. In the early morning or late afternoon, look for viewpoints that lay out the rocks in a half circle, one face in shadow and the other in light. Bryce is one of our most photogenic parks ... and don't forget the stretch of UT 12 east of the traffic circle. There are some great vistas between the circle and Tropic, and beyond Tropic UT 12 is one of America's most scenic byways. If you are heading for Moab, this is the route to take!"

We took the free shuttle that is offered and got off near the start of the trial. Right from the start, the views were mind-boggling. It's a long trail but worth every step to catch the sites we were able to see.
As we made our way along the trail we saw hoodoos, gorgeous cliffs, the amphitheater and so many beautiful and colorful formations. There was even a chipmunk who was smart enough to pose for photos at one of the stopping points.
When we got to the lodge we were very hungry and glad to be able to buy sandwiches and drinks before catching the shuttle back to the visitor center to leave."

I would have to concur with that statement. The park is BEAUTIFUL! There are so many varied hoodoos, and they are just stunning. They are so unique and beautiful. My husband agrees that this is his favorite national park, and we have visited 41 so far. We highly recommend the Canyon Trail Ride (half day is the most worthwhile) and hiking the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop trail. We've done both on the same day each visit.

We were lucky to find a room at the BC Lodge, which is a 5 min walk to the rim. The park offers shuttle service to the major lookout points but the rim area between sunset point and sunrise point is flat, paved and easy for anyone (even with mobility challenges) to enjoy the scenery. We hiked the Navajo Trail through Wall Street (amazing slot-like canyon) and then caught Peek A Boo trail (counter clockwise). Our original plan was to do the ""figure 8"" of these two trails totaling around 6 miles but it was hot and we were running low on water. We detoured up the trail to Bryce Point and caught a shuttle back to Sunset (where we started). There are compost toilets in the summer on Peek A Boo near Bryce point but there's no water. The park did not feel crowded in mid-July. There was steady flow of visitors but once you're a quarter mile from the rim on a trail you're not seeing many people. This is by far one of our favorite parks. It's not stressful due to crowds, it offers basic services (food, lodging, bathrooms with running water) and more honestly enjoyable than the madness we experienced at Zion & Arches."

In my opinion, Bryce is much more beautiful than Zion. All of the trails we hiked had simply spectacular views, felt safe, and most felt friendly for children and seniors. Photos simply do not do Bryce justice; the scenery is definitely distinct from Zion (although it's only a two-hour drive away), with the largest concentration of hoodoos in the whole world. Just make sure to dress warmly because it's much colder in Bryce. All in all, definitely stop by for a magnificent day in Bryce!"

The scenery is spectacular. We are older; we walk a lot, but are not hikers. We did the rim trail for most of the distance; we used the bus system between one short segment; we found the rim trail to be fairly walkable; there are grade changes, but nothing we couldn't handle. We used the shuttle system and found it to be well managed and easy to use; we shuttled to the far end and walked back (most of the way).
Younger folks who hike would probably enjoy the more challenging trails into the canyon. There is certainly a lot to explore and the scenery is unique and beautuiful. No matter your skill level--take water with you."

We did the Queen gardens trail going down into the hoodoos and came back up through the Navajo trail (Wallsteet). This is a bit challenging if not in a good shape, but it is well worth the hike. The total hike was about 4.5miles. Take your water, hat, and sunscreen with you. Plenty of rock squirrels and chipmunks. The amphitheater is just stunning. We visited late in the morning and parking was not an issue. The annual pass is a great way to see multiple NPs and it can be purchased from any of the NPs entry. We used ours to access 6 NPs in 2 weeks. It’s good for a year and costs $80. Entry to Bryce Canyon alone is $35 per car. We stayed in Kanab and drove 1.5hrs for a day trip to Bryce. Kanab is an easy launch pad for seeing Zion and Bryce and the city also has plenty to offer on its own."

We walked down Wallstreet trail and also did the easy Sunrise to Sunset trail - which clocked in at just about a mile of paved walking.

At the end, we found a ranger who suggested we to go Bryce Point to see the best sunset. We headed that way, had time to drive to Inspiration Point first, and saw the sunset which was really gorgeous. (Note-I imagined beach sunsets and sunrises, so had this as a major priority. In reality, it's more the way the light changes on what you are looking at which makes it a ""good time to go"". You won't see beautiful colors in the sky so much.)"

Unbelievable experience! We stayed near the park at a local motel in Panguitch. That allowed us to get an early start around 7:00 am which was a great decision. We were able to enter the park before collection booths were staffed (so we experienced the park without paying a fee.) We were traveling with our dog, so we needed to drive our car versus taking a shuttle or going on a tour. By chance, we ignored the first few vistas and headed further down the 18 mile scenic drive. (Sort of like skipping the first few rides and heading to the back rides when the amusement park opens up.) That meant that we got to all those additional scenic views with pull off areas without combatting any traffic, difficulties parking or large groups of other people. The final area at the end of that drive is a more area equipped with restrooms and tables. By the time were turned around and headed back to the entrance of the park around 9:00, the park had filled up. We tried to check out the first few vistas we skipped. That was difficult and we battled crowds at each attempt making driving, parking and viewing much more difficult. We did head out after spending about 2 hours in the park which was good enough for a first visit. And yes, the views were incredible."

You literally walk amongst the beauty and geology. Also it is relatively small and could be experienced in a single day if pressed for time. Please note that the temperatures vary a lot and while we were there in late May the temperature in the morning was in the low 30s and did not get above 55 the entire day. One negative in this park was the poor signage and markings in the trailheads and on the trails in particular. We could not find the start of the trails and could get lost on the trails themselves. We were not the only ones — we ran into folks who were asking us for directions while we ourselves did not know where we were. But overall , highly, highly recommended for a visit."

The towering hoodoo rock formations awash in bright splashes of brilliant, sunny colors will take your breath away.
You can certainly visit this park from the comfort of your own car. However, I would highly recommend devoting at least a full day here to hike the fantastic trails. Wall Street and Queens Garden were my two favorites. There's a wonderful loop that takes you from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point along those two trails and the Rim Trail along the canyon top.
Inspiration point is also another can't miss. Don't forget to hike the 5 to 10 minutes up from the parking lot to your right for it even more glorious vistas. The entire Canyon looks like a massive amphitheater filled with a packed audience of playful hoodoos.
The Natural Bridge is nice and worth a quick stop for a photo op. However, if you're tight on time, I don't think you need to drive past Inspiration Point."

You can take you car into Bryce tho there is a shuttle ( free ) but it doesn't go very far. I know not using a car in the parks is more environmentally good but sometimes the shuttle systems just don't work very well. Bryce has an 18 mile road up to a vista point. There are various trails from here. We did the Bristlecone Pine trail. One mile RT thru spruce/fir forests to cliffs with bristlecone pines and fantastic views. There were signs of a past fire up here. Being old folks, we don't do much hiking down into canyons anymore and this was a really nice trail for us. All along this 18 mile road there are areas to pull off for views or hikes. The hoodoos are gorgeous - red stone everywhere. Early the next morning we headed to the Mossy Cave trail - not to be missed either. You have to exit the park to get to this section. It is the only place in the park where the trail is completely on the canyon floor. Instead of looking down on the hoodoos you have to look up at them. There is a waterfall, stream and yes, there actually is a little mossy cave.
Don't miss Bryce Canyon."

Bryce is filled with Hoodoos - rocks that are weathered and eroded to create incredible formations. Fantastic to behold.
You can drive throughout the whole park and see some incredible and stunning views without hiking!
If you want to Hike:
Do the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden Trail. This takes you down into the canyon so you can walk among the shadow of the hoodoos. There is one with a switchback area of this trail called ‘Wall Street.” I recommend walking this section. Most people don’t know this and do the opposite. It is a 2.5 mile heavily trafficked loop trail.
Don't miss the Mossy Cave Waterfall hike. You must leave the park a tiny bit, but you get to see a waterfall and a sleeping bear cave. It is a magical beautiful hike. It is an easy 1-mile trail and you get to see a waterfall!
If you can do Bryce’s Rime Trail Hike. It is 0.5 miles to 5.5 miles one way and it is located above Bryce Canyon. It connects all the scenic overlooks from Fairyland to Bryce Point. If you do NOT want to hike, many of these viewpoints are accessible by car too! If you are looking for an accessible trail, there is a 0.5-mile section of trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point that is wheelchair accessible. I love the Rime Trail hike because you can choose to do as much or as little hiking as you want!"

This left us with expectations of Bryce that were not realistic. Don't get me wrong, it was gorgeous just not what we anticipated. In Zion you are usually looking up and surrounded by canyons, cliffs and rock formations. With Bryce we were always looking down on the interesting topography and unless there was time to hike down and back, you couldn't get close and personal to the fantastic structures. We did much research and read that the road in and back is 15-18 miles long. Every scenic overlook or hiking trail turns off to the west, which would be a left turn across traffic if you stopped at each one along the way in. Taking the road to the end and working our way back allowed us to turn with traffic. This was late April, the roads were crowded and parking was sparse and we cannot imagine how this will play out as summer draws near. That being said, Bryce Canyon was a fantastically magical sort of place and we are so glad to have experienced this wonder of nature!"

Bryce did not disappoint. We arrived around noon and were able to do a variety of hikes and viewing around the park over 7 hours. We could probably have done the park in two days but we were fine with one.
I highly recommend going to the back of the parks 18 mile road and working your way towards the front. By the end of the day, we barely had any traffic but at noon when we arrived, the front parking lots were full.
Our favorite hike was the Navajo/Queens loop. You really get to see the amazing hoodoos up close. The hike has some elevation and steep switchbacks, but it’s so worth it. There are also a lot of lookout points while driving, take advantage of them all."

This National Park has always been one of my favorites, the views are stunning. I do suggest going to the top first and make your stops on the way down. Right now the shuttles were not running so you were able to drive your own car, we did not have any issues finding parking but I’m sure that will be changing shortly. A lot of people miss out on the Mossy Cave hike. It’s a easy 1 mile round trip and you will see some amazing scenery.

Bryce Canyon National Park is stunning! As you drive towards it you get a tiny tease as the landscape begins to change. But nothing can tip the moment you step onto the first viewing spot. It is breathtaking...almost a spiritual experience.
The visitor center is right after entering the park. Worth a stop to get the Rangers’ insight on what to see and do. “Icy trails” update altered my visit a bit. I drove to the opposite end of the park, Rainbow Point, and then stopped at viewing points on the way back. I even set up a tailgate picnic for lunch - best PB&J I’ve ever had.
Make it a point to hike to the top of Inspiration Point. It is the best view and photo op, in my opinion.

After doing the scenic drive and stopping at sites and looking out and down, we spent the next day hiking into Bryce Canyon and experiencing it from a different viewpoint. What incredible scenery. It is spectacular and worth visiting.
Based on a fellow traveller's tip, we hiked Navajo trail and then went to Queen's Garden. So down and then up and since Queen's Garden is less ""vertically upward"" while still challenging, it did give us more of a chance to really focus on the hoodoos and mountains as we wound our way upward. Bring walking sticks - they help.
This park is a must see. We lucked out as the November day was gorgeous, sunny and warm."

We had visited the Grand Canyon the day before, which was spectacular, but I really think I loved Bryce even more.
We drove to the very end of the loop without stopping and then stopped at all the stops on the way back. When we went it was not crowded at all and parking was not a problem (sometimes it is but apparently, not during a pandemic). People were wearing masks, for the most part but I wasn't worried because everything was outdoors.
Bryce is one of the most unique places. I enjoyed the Grand Canyon but it is very GRAND. Bryce felt smaller and more intimate. Even though we didn't go down in to the canyon, I felt like I was more a part of it then at the Grand Canyon. Such BEAUTIFUL scenery - everywhere you look is a picture.
I can't recommend this National Park highly enough - so beautiful and so thankful it has been preserved so beautifully."

We wanted to stay in their tree house but they only have two and they were full. We got a cabin that was awesome. They also have a fantastic restaurant on site, beautiful view and fantastic food...make reservations.
We got up early to view the sunrise at Bryce Canyon at Sunset Point and it was breathtaking. Take a tripod and watch the magic happen. Wear layers, walking stick, good walking shoes, hat, sunscreen, water and camera. The hike amongst the hoodoos is fantastic, take your time, stop and rest, enjoy your surroundings and keep hydrated. After our hike we went out through the park entrance and ate breakfast, then we stopped at the park information center and signed up for a night sky ranger talk for later that night.
We went back into the park and stopped at different look outs. We ate dinner at our lodge and went back for night sky viewing and talk about stars and planets. We did faintly see the Milky Way. We also went back to the hoodoos at night and took photos. It was my first try at night sky photography with an iPhone. They were a bit blurry but you can get some great photos at night! Try it.
Visually stimulating park. Definitely recommend seeing this once in your lifetime."

They had just gotten a lot of snow so some of the hikes were closed and some of the walks were snowy/icy. We did Inspiration point, Bryce point, Sunset point, and Sunrise. Inspiration point parking was icy and a few people got stuck trying to get in. We had a 4 wheel drive care so we didn’t have any problems. Just to see the views is worth the $35 fee. You receipt is good for 7 days so if you are planning on spending a few days hiking it’s extremely worth the cost. The visitors center is really nice and the park staff is super helpful. They are very knowledgeable and can help with any of your trail questions. I definitely recommend hiking boots and chains in the snow. We had on sneakers and they didn’t have enough traction.

Although not one of the most popular parks, Bryce is full of unique rock structures and formations. There is no other place like this anywhere on Earth. The hoodoo rocks are interesting and formed through a erosion process that is not present anywhere else. In late October crowds were very reasonable with ample parking everywhere we visited.
There are several hikes that you can do in Bryce Canyon National Park. Navajo Loop and queens Garden trails are the most popular, and they're great to do. If you don't like to hike, you can drive around and stop at various you points to see the rock formations. In all honesty, the views are actually best from on top before you hike down into the canyon.
Either way, Bryce Canyon National Park is one of the national parks that you simply must visit."

The scenery is obviously amazing - beautiful, and there is so much variety throughout the park and all its hikes. Definitely do the Quee's Garden/Navajo loop hike - it's a bit challenging but certainly worth it. I'd recommend going through Wall Street on that hike in the afternoon, as it lights up beautifully with the afternoon sun. (Also I'd go UP the Navajo Loop side - I think some of the steep bits would feel slippery coming down but going up they are just steep and require The occasional break.) The scenic drive was all right, but if you have limited time I'd skip most of it and spend most of your time between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point, as there is so much beauty and so many hikes there. The paved trail from the campground to Sunset Point is a decent length for walking dogs if you bring yours, and you can see some great views from it.
The campgrounds are clean and spaced out, although it's difficult to visit since they are all reservation-less during late fall and it can be hit or miss whether you will find a site even getting there early. The rangers at the sites gave very helpful talks and tips, although the ones at the campground seemed a little overzealous. I understand that they have a tough job, but the day we were there they drove around every 20-30 minutes all morning and afternoon, staring down people sitting outside and not waving back or ever saying hello. While it wasn't bad, it had the effect of making me feel like a kid in school again, wondering if I was breaking a rule I didn't know about."

We visited at sunset, then the next day sunrise and we hiked. I think sunrise was the best but sunset also beautiful. I would highly recommend parking near SUNSET point (not sunrise) for the sunrise and you can hike down a little to the Thor’s Hammer to get a nice opportunity. We saw sunrise from that area but moved around a little. Then, we hiked down the Navajo trail going down Wall Street and the switchbacks and then to the queens trail to sunrise point. Glad we did it that way. Many people went the opposite direction. But, I heard that this was a good direction to take."

It was surreal landscape you would never see anywhere else. We only went to Sunrise and Sunset points (we parked at the lodge and walked to them) and did the Queen’s Garden hike. The hike does have some very steep sections at the beginning, but other than that it wasn’t too difficult. We had a 3 year old (we had a leash attached to his arm just in case because there were major drop-offs) and an 8 year old and they handled it just fine. In the time of COVID I will say there were definitely sections of this hike that were narrow and we were there in the afternoon so there were lots of people, so we were glad we had our masks. We also did the quick Mossy Cave hike, which leads to a waterfall. The water was very cold, but the kids loved it. Again, lots of people so social distancing was not easy. If you’re in the area we’d recommend devoting at least a half day to see Bryce Canyon, it was definitely worth the time."

Our first stop was staying at Ruby’s to hike Bryce Canyon. This was my husbands first hikey vacation so we started out easy.
We followed the trail to the left for the Navajo Loop. Folks of all ages were managing just fine from papoose carrying dads to little kids to near seniors like ourselves.
Coming through the Wall Street was breath taking and just awww bit challenging. The key is to rest and drink plenty of water.
Next we drove to the end of the park and stopped at every vista along the way. Each view was better and majestic. We took a short windy hike at the end and headed back to base for a swim. Fantastic day!"

Take the 18 mile park road and stop at several of the sights along the way. They all look different and they are special in there own way. The great arch is a personal favorite.
Then walk some or one of the trails. The Navajo loop is the best, but its not for the faint at heart and is an extremely difficult climb back to the top.

The landscapes is other-worldly. Hoo-Doos (pronounced Who-DOOZ) are in the canyons. You can hike down into them if you like. But you would lose the incredible overview.

Outside of the canyon, the grounds are wooded and well kept. This park is made for cars but somehow is not over-run. You can walk 50 feet or less from your car and see all of the items I posted on this review. If you wish, the well made paths will lead into the canyon too."

Bryce Canyon is a series of natural amphitheaters or bowls, carved into the edge of a high plateau. The most famous of these is the Bryce Amphitheater, which is filled with irregularly eroded spires of rocks called hoodoos.

If you have time, hike below the rim among the hoodos on trails like Queens Garden/Navajo loop and the Peekaboo trail, it feels like a different planet.

The sights are unbelievable everywhere you turn. Be careful hiking unless you are acclimated to the higher altitude.
Service from the rangers was just great. Very helpful and kind. The visitor's center is quite nice with lots of helpers and a nice selection of travel treats.
Plan on at least two days to get as much in as possible. We did a few trails in just one day and wish we had more time to explore.
We did try and stay awake for the star gazing and made it till 9:30pm. I was happy to see more stars than I have ever seen, although for the full show I suspect one needs to be awake at midnight or 1am.
However as we were leaving, we saw a herd of deer grazing in one pasture and on the opposite side of the road the buck keeping watch. That was a magnificent moment, as I have seen deer before but never a herd or group! Wonderful!
Nonetheless, this quick trip was well worth every minute and a nice respite from being locked down in our home state.
We knew coming in the views and sights would be beautiful. What we did not know was just how amazing and well, simply wonderful they would be."

I had seen pictures. But until you see it in person—you have no idea. To beat the crowds, we arrived at 0830 on a Sunday. We had the place to ourselves. What you read advises you to go to the far point and stop at points on the way back, as they are all on the right side of the road—which is what we did. Not sure I agree with that. By the time we arrived at sunrise/sunset/inspiration points, the most popular points,about 1100, it was very crowded. Had I it to do over, I would stop at these places first, before the crowds. Another note, if you’re into photography, morning isn’t the best time, as at most points you’re facing east and many views are in shadow. Great pictures are going to be in the afternoon."

We used Just Ahead, a national parks app, and it directed us where to go and what we would see, if there were trails it would say how long, how far and if it was strenuous.

This is a great place to take photos and to hike. We combined the Queen’s Court Trail descent with the Navajo Trail ascent for a 3 mile hike. The descent was a little scary for me because of the sharp, steep drop offs at many points on the trail, sometimes on both sides. However, it was not difficult to stay safe, you just need to be aware. Its not a place where you can walk along while staring at your phone screen. Most of the trails lead down to the canyon floor where you wind through the rock formations before you have to ascend back to the top. There is no way to avoid an ascent. The trail we took stayed mostly along the canyon floor until the very end. The ascent consisted of a series of at least a dozen or more short switchbacks which were very steep. We ended our hike just before noon. It was a beautiful day, not all that hot, we are both in good shape and we found the ascent extremely strenuous since all of the elevation gain was packed in at the very end. We still enjoyed the hike and the park is amazing. I have hiked through other hoodoo formations before, but the sheer enormity and concentration of formations here is something that must be experienced. A photo cannot do it justice."

I went for a day and visited all viewpoints. The bad thing was that all the smoke from the California wild fires filled the canyon with haze so it was all a bit nasty. My favorite viewpoint was Sunset Point and Inspiration Point, super cool places! I also recommend hiking down to Thor's Hammer and Wall Street when you're at Sunset Point. Sunrise and Sunset Point where both busy in the morning (Labor Day) and I couldn't find parking so I went to the very end and worked my way backwards. I would recommend though that before you go, make this more a hiking experience than a I go to viewpoint and look into the canyon experience. I'm not a hiker and just wanted to see stuff and I got the impression that the majority of people came for the hikes and actually hiked. Only doing Wall Street and Thor's Hammer, I really have to say, check out all the hikes and go on several because I personally felt that Bryce is, say compared to Grand Canyon, more of a hiking park than view point park!"

It's other worldly, stunning, awe-inspiring, magical. It's weird and wonderful! It's a very easy park to visit and you can make it whatever you want. If you want to just get out of your car and see the sites from the viewpoints, that's great and you'll see amazing scenery. If you want to hike and explore, there are many trails that take you down into wonderlands or across the rim. We especially like Yovimpa Point, the area in the southern part of the park. The Bristlecone Pine trail is fairly easy and not very long but gives you time in the forest.
We've enjoyed camping at Bryce before but this time we stayed at Ruby's Inn - a wonderful choice right outside the park.
Watch for deer and squirrels and several kinds of birds. Look off into the distance to see mountains far away. Study the colors of the rock, various shades of orange and some with white tops. Go out and look at the night sky! You'll see thousands more stars than if you try in a city.
The view areas had social distancing reminders that were fun - see the pictures!"

You can easily walk around on the rim. There are points that will offer great sunrise or sunset pictures. Heading down into the canyon is a must if you can. We did the Navajo/Queen's Garden Combination Loop Trail. We started it by Sunrise Point and headed down into the canyon. The trail has uneven surfaces but once you get to the bottom it is pretty easy. They categorize this trail as moderate. Had we started at Sunset Point I would say it is moderate because we would be going down through the endless switchbacks. We chose to go up the switchback which was strenuous.

We started our day at 8 am and went to the Shuttle Stop across from Ruby’s Inn. We purchased a park pass which gave us access to the free shuttle to take us through Bryce National Park. We stopped first at the Visitor Center and immediately went to the Information Tent outside. I signed us up for the Night Ranger Talk held at the North Amphitheater at 9pm. They only allow 40 people during COVID so you must sign up the same day and early. Then we hopped back on the shuttle and went to Bryce Point. This was one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. You can see the entire amphitheater from this view point. We took the advice from the shuttle driver and hiked the Rim Trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point about a 1.5 mile hike. If you are afraid of heights do not go. I was at first but then was so glad I went. It was a moderate hike and I would not take young children. Some parts are very narrow and the edge is very close. We hiked to Inspiration Point and hopped back on the shuttle back to the Shuttle Stop where we started. My son then rented a mountain bike for $25 for half a day and rode an 8 mile trail to Red Rock Canyon. I picked him up at the Tunnel. Then we rested back in our room. We went for dinner at The Pizza Place in Tropic and on our way back we stopped at Mossy Cave hike. It is very easy about half a mile and there is a small waterfall that you can walk behind. This was a great stop and highlight of our trip. Then we went back to room and rested and left for our night program at 8:30. The outdoor amphitheater has benches and a movie screen. The ranger spoke about animals seen at the canyon. One is the best parts was you could see a million stars in the sky just from sitting in the amphitheater. The ranger talk lasted 40 minutes and we were done for the day at 10 pm. Awesome day!"

If you’ve seen the Grand Canyon then this should be next on your list.
I wish I could have given it 5 stars but the park isn’t too RV friendly.
I visited the park with my wife and our dog in our 29 foot class C motor home.
The problem is RVs longer than 20 feet are NOT allowed to park anywhere near the most important “must see” viewing areas. RVs of that length are either required to park at the visitor center overflow; which would then require about a 3 mile round trip walk to the sights. Or someone is required to circle the area in the RV while the rest of the party goes to see the hoodoos.
On top of that dogs are only allowed on hardened surface pathways which is tough on their feet.
So if you’re planning a trip to Bryce Canyon NP. Leave your dogs at home and park outside the park and use the shuttle."

We were told the mile and a half hike to Inspiration Point along the rim was relatively easy and had great views, so we decided to do that. We had a backpack full of Ice and Gatorade, sunscreen, and baseball caps, so we felt prepared for the 90+ degree journey. We took our time and meandered along, stopping whenever we wanted pictures or to enjoy a bit of the shade. Our home is at sea level, so we are not used to the elevation at all, and that was obvious anytime there was a bit of an elevation gain along our trail.
One of the best things was that even though we were there on a Sunday and it was crowded at the visitor center when we arrived, we only saw two other couples on our entire trek along that part of the rim. We felt like we were completely alone, which was very peaceful.
There was no problem getting on the shuttle when it was time to move on. We chose to stop at Sunset Point and see the views from there, and while beautiful, not comparable to what we had already seen. The shuttle wasn’t running to Rainbow Point, and we felt like we had seen enough, so decided to call it a day. I’m sure we missed out on some amazing views, but we were happy with how we spent our time at Bryce Canyon."

On the way back I spent a day at Bryce Canyon National Park. I had seen so many photos I was worried that nothing could really be so dramatic, I was wrong, photos don't do it justice! The expansive landscape of salmon colored Hodoo towers and Fin ridges is other worldly and the park is much larger in person.
The views from the overlooks are breathtaking, but the best experience is to take one or all of the trails down into the valley and back up through the sculptural stone towers. The trails are well designed, wide enough in many areas for 4 people across, they narrow down to go through towering ravines or stone openings. I also found the grades to be gradual and comfortable. But be prepared to climb up hill, the trip elevations changes range from 200 to 1500 feet. I was told the Navajo Trail/Queens Garden loop that I took had a 480 foot elevation change.
For me one day was not enough, I'd recommend at least two to give you time to explore north and south park trails. I guarantee you'll enjoy it!"

It is always better to get out in the parks and hike them. We choose to hike the Fairyland trail which is about 8 miles. It doesn’t have as many hoodoos but there are a lot less people on that side of the canyon. You do need to take plenty of water. We ended up being a water bottle short.

We went up inspiration point for the perfect views and then did the Navajo loop trail...so much fun! It’s about a 1.2 mile loop. It’s much easier if you start the loop to the right (towards Wall Street) than the other way around. We didn’t have much time but would have loved to continue the trail into peek a boo or queens garden (all connect). A lot of shade around the trails but take water and expected to be dirty.

The park was not too crazy busy. The views around Sunrise Point and Sunset Point are the BEST! We also did the Queen's Garden, Navajo Loop, and portion leading to Wall Street trails. Simply stunning. I had read in previous reviews that the best lighting is in the early morning/around noon - and this was very true. As it got later in the day, the lighting was not as good for photos. If you are going on any of the hikes, be sure to wear hiking boots or tennis shoes with enough tread on them, as the trails can be steep and slippery without proper footwear. Also, bringing enough water is a must - at the higher elevation, you get tired more easily and the trails do not have a ton of shade - you will definitely need proper hydration! After we did the hikes, we drove the 18 miles down to the end of the park to Rainbow point, and then stopped at the scenic pull-outs on the way back. The drive and turn-out spots were beautiful, but the most impressive part of the park is the main Bryce amphitheater by Sunrise and Sunset Points. If you have a limited amount of time in the park, I would recommend skipping the drive and focusing on the hikes/viewpoints around the main amphitheater. The visitor center did have a nice gift shop - but if you're looking for snacks/drinks, those are located at the park general store. We did see several deer, as well, so be on the lookout for wildlife.
Overall, Bryce Canyon exceeded my expectations (definitely up there with the Grand Canyon in terms of amazing scenery!). We had been at Cedar Breaks National Monument just before getting to Bryce Canyon, and Bryce Canyon is definitely more amazing (but totally worth stopping there as well, if time permits). If in the area it is a must see/do! Definitely doable in 1 day or 1/2 a day!"

We hiked two trails in addition to the rim walk. The Mossy Cave trail outside of the park was crowded, but for the most part, people were wearing masks. People on the Peekaboo trail were considerate and moved to the side or pulled up their masks, especially if we pulled ours up.

The Visitor Center is recommended as a first stop for getting situated, obtaining recommendations for hikes that fit your level of fitness, as well as learning about any closures or things that may impact your stay at the time of your visit.
This is a place that affords ample opportunities for the photographer. Starting with the hoodoos, you’ll also see foliage up close, as well as wonderful panoramic vistas that stretch far and wide.
A great treasure with well-maintained hiking trails. Highly recommended."

We arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park and planned what we do for the afternoon that we were there. Since we only had a few hours at the park, we went over the different trails available that run along the canyon. The heat of 100+ degrees in July and the elevation at 8100 ft. had some impact on our choice of trail to do.
There is a shuttle system within the park to get to various locations without having to drive and park. There is a guide for the various hiking routes with their distance, time, and level of difficulty to help one decide what trail to use.
We chose a 1.5 mile hike along the Rim Trail overlooking the canyon starting at Bryce Point and ending at Sunset Point. It was relatively flat, and even with the heat and altitude, it was an east walk to get several perspectives of the Canyon.
The highlight of Bryce Canyon are the so called “hoodoo” formations that are pinnacle like structures eroded from the sandstone. We were able to see such features as Thors Hammer and Wall Street, as well as some of the trails down below in the canyon that would have been interesting has we more time at the park.
Following our hike, we ate at a quick serve eatery next to The Lodge and Restaurant and had a little time for souvenirs at the large gift/souvenir shop.
It was a beautiful, cloudless sky, and ideal for our short visit to view this picturesque canyon and its interesting rock formations."

Hike as many of the loop trails that you can. They all have something different to offer. My suggestion is to do all of the hiking first on one day. Day 2 go see a sunrise at sunrise point. Then drive all the the way to the end of the road without stopping. Do the bristle cone loop trail there, and then start the drive back to the entrance stopping at the view points on the way back. 2 full days was enough for us but some people may choose to spend more.

Layer your clothes as temperature fluctuates greatly depending on the time of day and where you are in the canyon. If you want a stamp in your national parks passport hit the visitor center early otherwise the wait can be long due to restrictions on the number of people permitted at one time. If it’s bathrooms and souvenirs you want, the lodge in town has an amazing selection. We hiked the 1.3 mile Navajo loop and LOVED it! It was definitely worth getting into the canyon. Wear hiking shoes, bring water and snacks and plan to take it slow due to the incline. I’d suggest going down towards Two Bridges first so you can come up the more gradual switchbacks through Wall Street. Beautiful, breathtaking views. So glad we visited! No lines to get in and parking was not an issue at any of the pullouts in the early part of June since reopening after Covid-19 shutdown."

On my second more recent trip there, my wife and I again hiked into the canyon and did the Navaho Trial though Wall Street and then came up the Queens Garden Trail on our return. It took us a very leisurely 2 1/2 hours. Being in our mid to upper 60's and considering the elevation of over 8,000 feet, I would advise avoiding a hike during the heat of the day. My wife is in excellent shape but being on a beta blocker, she had difficulty ascending the hike back up. For most people in reasonable shape this is a very manageable hike. I got up before sunrise both of our mornings and Sunset Point is spectacular at sunrise. The two trails we hiked feature spectacular scenery of the famous rock formations called hoodoos. Peekaboo Loop looks even more awesome but is a much more demanding and lengthier hike. As there are limited options in and around Bryce, I would highly recommend staying at the Bryce Lodge for convenience and value. But you have to book the property way in advance to get the dates you want. I think an arrival in the afternoon followed by one full day and one more morning is the perfect amount of time if you want to hike into the canyon. (2 nights) We went in mid to late September which was perfect. I'm guessing late May to mid June would be equally good timing as the nights can get cold even in May and September. We've been to all of the national parks in Utah and Arizona. Bryce is the gem of them all. Hiking below and along the hoodoos watching them change colors is simply awesome and unforgettable."

The hoodoos formation here is quite unique, not common in other national park, I think the scenery here is even better than those in Grand canyon, much better than in Zion, of course they are different styles, you will see different geology in different parks, but this is certainly the one you don't want to miss it."

One side of the street is trees for miles and the other side is hoodoo's galore which we found amusing. We spent a day here hiking many different trails, we found it awesome that one of the trails still had snow - and a lot of it. It was so much fun falling in the snow unexpectedly - we laughed so hard so many different times from our falls. I never thought I would see a place like this with my own eyes, it was so hard to hike with the simple fact that I just wanted to stand there and take in the beauty at every turn. We ended up skipping dinner to stay and watch the sunset and watch the stars come out, there were so many stars and you can see the milky-way which was pretty neat. If you are deciding between Zion and Bryce because you cannot do both my thoughts are this - for hiking Zion is better but from a majestic/picturesque standpoint Bryce wins!"

In addition to the beautiful easy access driving through the park and stopping at overlooks, we also brought our snowshoes (although they can be rented locally...or even supplied for free if you take one of the ranger-led tours.) We snowshoed on a few of the trails, and even ""off-trail"" on one of the ridges overlooking the vista. Our favorite was the Bristlecone Pine trail. We hardly EVER saw another person on any of our hikes this time of year. The contrast of the brilliant blue sky with the vermillion of the sandstone features, all contrasted with pristine white snow was spectacular. Then add in the green of the ancient bristlecone pines, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Another event we attended was the telescope presentation (once a week during winter, more often during peak seasons). It was worth the night time trip back into the park as we viewed the Orion Nebula, Venus, distant galaxies and more. My favorite part of that experience was having the staff point out and name various constellations, which I do not have the imagination to pick out myself. This winter visit was a long-time wish and we are glad we went. FYI the overlooks on the main road are very accessible for any ability (and many who are disabled.)"

We went to Bryce Canyon National Park. It is amazing ! Awesome ! Inspiring ! We drove up the mountain on the well maintained paved road, stopping at every viewing spot along the way. We did some walking and some stair climbing for better views, but this park is for everyone and anyone. Many of the views can be appreciated without ever geting out of your vehicles. Minimal walking is required for a better view from the lookouts. There are free bus shuttles if you prefer to not drive at all. Or, for the real dedicated hiker, you can hike the trails following close to the rim, from one lookout to the next until you reach the top, and then take the shuttle back down to your parked vehicle. Dress warm and in layers as the temperature can vary at higher altitude (8,900ft) The scenery is amazing with magnificent colors. Bryce Canyon National Park was our Highlight spot for 2019.

For as long as I can remember I’ve been wanting to go to Bryce but I wasn’t expecting to go there in the winter time. Although it was beautiful we really didn’t bring the proper hiking shoes nor equipment. I actually brought some really cute summer dresses and sandals to wear in the warm weather that didn’t even come out of my bag.
Someone took the time to make a little snow people, one even had a stick for its little snow dog, they were so dang cute!

Our group was surprised that although limited we were able to thoroughly enjoy Sunset Point, hike several great trails, and enjoy great views like Wall Street, Inspiration Point, and others. Bryce Canyon hoodoos covered with beautiful light Utah snow are very special and worth every penny of the $35 entry fee. We had just come from Zion and actually enjoyed the deeper snow, different geology, and geomorphology of Bryce. The area outside Bryce on Route 63 has a few tacky outside-of-the-park attractions. Springdale, Utah outside of Zion provides nicer facilities than the area outside of Bryce. Best time of year to enjoy both is probably mid fall or late spring.

In any case, they are fairly close together, all in the same geological setting and make for a good week trip together.
Bryce Canyon is not really a Canyon but a large erosional feature in the uppermost step of the Escalante staircase of the broken-up Colorado plateau .. also for the geological layman the difference with a Canyon is clear since the cliff is essentially one-sided. The easygoing rim trail gives walking distance access to the most important viewpoints, and notably sunset point and sunrise point which are close together. By walking the Navajo trail from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point (or vice versa) one has immediate access to the Amphitheatre itself and can get up close and personal with the Hoodoos. If you do one thing in Bryce beyond walking the rim, it should be walking the Navajo trail, maybe combined with Wall Street.
We found the Lodge inside the park excellent accomodation also in Winter (close January and February though). Crawling distance from the rim which makes it easy to visit Sunset and Sunrise points at the right times of the day. Dinner is a 15 minute drive to e.g. Bryce Canyon Pines (recommended) in Bryce Canyon City just outside the National Park."

We went down to the corral and I was matched up with Blaze and my husband was on a mule named Clyde. The wranglers were friendly and also let us know what we needed to do to stay safe on the ride. The scenery from the trails was breathtaking! I do have to say that at times those turns were tight on steep terrain so I just trusted the horse! It was truly a once in a lifetime experience! I would highly recommend this adventure!
Bryce Canyon itself is incredible! We drove to the highest point and stopped at all the outlooks on the way down, then we hopped on the tourist bus to do a few more!!
We went back at night, the views without any light pollution was unbelievable, almost forgot how incredible the Milky Way is to observe.
Love this National Park!!!"

Throw in the wind chill and an elevation of (8000'-9000'), and it was cold. Most of the popular viewpoints are centered around the hoodoo amphitheater (see photos). This is essence of Bryce Canyon National Park. This is where the exciting hiking and horse trails are located, and where you will find the most awesome land features. They is a vast array of hiking opportunities, both easy and difficult. We watched a film in the visitors center (22 minutes) that gave a very general overview of the park's history.

The drive into the Canyon is nothing much and does not prepare you for the views you are about to witness. Yes it was a little bit unclear were you need to go to, but the visitors center is a must and will give you the necessary pointers. From the visitors center car park it is possible to walk into the canyon, but we found it better to move your car up to Sunset point. Yes there are lots of cars and tour buses but we had no issues parking. Here it is a short walk to the Rim Trail. Our first view out into the canyon just blew us away. Amazing!! Stunning ... there's not enough words to describe the place. Move away from the busy areas and you will we rewarded. /We chose to walk the North Rim Trail around to Bryce Point where we then descended in to the Canyon on the Peek-a-boo Trailhead. Yes you need to be well prepared and have a good level of fitness as the walk down to the canyon floor is often steep and winding, but you are rewarded at every turn because the views are stunning. It just keeps on getting better, you think you've seen the best but then you turn the next corner and.... Be careful it's dangerous in places and take plenty of water and have the correct footwear. We saw plenty of people badly prepared and some taking big risks. The canyon floor is a long way down, it's worth it, but remember you have to climb back up to the car parks....
Stunning Place....."

We came from Capitol Reef so we ended up hiking the Mossy cave trail before getting to the Park's proper entrance. Once we arrived we started at the visitor center, they have some interactive displays, a really nice gift store and an informative movie. We opted to start the next day with the scenic drive to try to beat some of the crowds and it worked perfectly. TIP: For the scenic drive, go all the way to the end Yovimpa point, then stop at each lookout on your way back. All the lookouts are on the left side of the road so if you do them all on your way back you are not having to cross traffic, easy in and out and by starting at the end we were by ourselves at several lookouts. Lots of great hiking in this park. The elevation may impact some people. I also thought the rating of the hikes was not accurate, especially given the elevation. Seemed like some of the easy should be listed as more moderate. Queens Garden is the least steep to get into the Caynon but it is still steep."

Took pix and did some hikes which were wonderful! Highly recommend hiking the Bristlecone Trail at the last stop out on the point as well as hiking down either Sunrise or Sunset Points to the valley and also checking out Inspiration Point hike, all easy to moderate. Remember water, sun hat, sunglasses, and good shoes with traction when hiking in southern Utah! So the special things about Bryce include the hoodoos, the pine trees, the light colored stone, and the free shuttles (Zion has them too). You gotta go!"

We then walked to Sunset and Sunrise points and caught the shuttle back to the visitors center. We then drove to Rainbow Point, at the end of the park, with very little traffic.

Here you will find information at the Ranger Help Desk, exhibits, a 22-minute film and maps and souvenirs.
Bryce is not a single canyon unlike say the Grand Canyon. It is a series of huge amphitheatres carved into a high plateau. They are huge and are filled with irregularly eroded spires of rock called hoodoos. Bryce contains the largest concentration of hoodoos in the world.
Over two million visitors come to Bryce National Park each year, most in the March to October period. Every visitor spends at least some time marvelling at the views from the four main viewpoints and walking the trails between them. I strongly suggest the 1.6 kilometer paved trail along the edge of the amphitheatre between Sunset and Sunrise Points. Then you need to venture down into the hoodoos via the Navajo Loop Trail or the Queens Garden Trail.
Accommodation within the park is limited to the rustic Lodge at Bryce Canyon and the North and South campgrounds which are near the Lodge and the Visitor Center."

And what a sight ... from sorts of perspectives, views of magically colored cliffs and formations , spited, cut-out curtains of eroding rock. There are trails heading upward from the forested rim, or down, if you dare, into the canyon. The colors change with the light. My little granddaughter loves the hoodoos - the eroding formations that wind up looking like rock statues. Summer rains, freezing at night and expanding cracks in the rock, help erode these formations rapidly as geology goes. We tried out several moderate walks with stunning views. Bryce is not as crowded as Zion, but you still need to plan at least 6 months in advance for lodging. If you go to any Utah parks, make sure you see this one, too!"

The bus will stop at each point of interest so don't worry if your not really a hiker.

We used a National Parks Pass that allowed us to enter Bryce Canyon National Park for free. The regular price is $30 per vehicle.
Our first stop was the Ranger Station/ interpretive Centre which is about 100 yards pass the entrance on the right. There is no parking here. You will have to do a short drive pass the centre, turn left and park in the lot and a short walk back to the centre.
Sunset Point and the Rim Trail were our first stops after the info centre. Sunset Point has the short paved Rim trail hike near the parking lot. The trail is similar to the Grand Canyon Rim trail hike on a paved trail but much shorter.
Queens Garden Trail
We started on the Queens Garden trail (to the left on the Rim Trail) going clockwise on a gentle downhill. The trail here is mostly compact dirt and gravel with some exposed rocks. There is a lot of amazing scenery of the rock formations with lots of photo ops. One of the highlights here is the Queen Victoria formation, a rock formation that looks that looks like her profile.
Navajo Loop Trail
Adjoining the Queens Garden Trail is the Navajo Loop Trail. We joined the trail and hiked up the “Wall Street” trail. This trail is through a canyon “slot” with steep walls on both sides. The trail itself is compact dirt and gravel with some man-made steps and short switchbacks near the top. The hardest part of the trail is going up, about a 1/4 - 1/3 mile climb. It may be difficult for those with mobility and / or cardio issues but not impossible. We joined the Navajo Loop trail part way through the Queens Garden Trail and missed the Thors Hammer rock formation. Our loop of the trail was about (Queens Garden and partial Navajo Loop) was about 5 kilometers / 3.1 miles. If you want to do the complete Navajo Loop Trail and go downhill to start (probably the easier option), go to Sunset Point and start with “Wall Street” section.
Inspiration Point
At Inspiration Point there are 3 viewpoints with the first one being paved and closest to the parking lot. There are very short hikes, maybe 200-300 meters, for the next 2 viewpoints on a compact dirt and gravel trail. There are washrooms and a bus stop here. Inspiration Point has parking for about 60 cars.
Bryce Point
Bryce Point has a short paved trail with parking for about 75 cars. This is also a bus shuttle stop. There are some nice views and worth a 15-20 minute stop.
Natural Bridge Viewpoint has parking for 40+ vehicles and is worth a 5-10 minute stop.
Agua Canyon Viewpoint has parking for about 12 vehicles and is worth a 5 minute stop.
Rainbow Point is at the end of all the sites. There are parking spots for 100 plus vehicles and there are washrooms here. There is a short paved trail that offers views of the Canyon. We headed off to the right and the Bristlecone loop, an out and back with a loop about 1.6 km (1 mile) in length. The trail consists of mostly compact dirt and gravel. From the first lookout to the second one is uphill and about 200 meters.
If you have visited the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon National Park is comparable and even better according to my fellow hikers; not because of the size but the fact you are walking on the canyon floor with amazing rock formations surrounding you.
I would rate the overall experience 5 out of 5.
Notes &Tips:
• At the interpretive centre there are washrooms and a gift shop. Pick up your park map here. Plan your visit on the internet before you get here so you’ll know in advance what you want to see.
• The park “drive” is basically an out and back route on a paved road with our first “Point” being Sunrise and the last one being Rainbow / Yovimpa. There were a few other viewpoints that we did not stop at
• In total we spent about 6-7 hours in the park
• Bring suntan lotion and wear a hat. During the last week of September it was still hot and sunny.
• I would recommend a good pair of trail runners or day hikers and definitely no flip-flops!
• Pack a picnic lunch and bring water. There are picnic tables, washrooms and water near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Bryce Canyon Lodge has a restaurant.
• There was a good mix of old and young people with lots of seniors (65+). Some people were using hiking poles but in my opinion they are not necessary depending upon your age.
• Parking spots may be in short supply depending upon when you arrive and the time of the season. We were there during the last week of September and it was busy but were lucky to get a parking spot near Bryce Canyon Lodge and it was a very short walk to the Rim Trail. If the parking lot is full you will have to park in the overflow lots and take the free shuttle buses to the various viewpoints. The free shuttle buses stop at all the viewpoints throughout the park.
• We saw Steller’s Jay birds and a chipmunk on our hikes
• There are camp grounds inside the park
• We were on our first day of our 13 day Nevada-Arizona-Utah trip. We were off to Moab and Goblin Valley next. Other national parks we visited on this trip included Arches, Canyonlands and Zion. See my reviews.
• State and private parks we visited included Goblin Valley, Monument Valley, Lower and Upper Antelope and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. See my reviews.
• Buy an annual pass if you plan to visit more than 3 national parks in the next 12 months."

The hoodoos are simply stunning. There are many viewpoint and you really need to spend a day here to see as many as possible. You can drive your car through the park or take the free shuttle.
Trying to narrow down which are the best viewpoints is difficult but the general consensus is that the first four (Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce) are must sees. I would also recommend Rainbow, Natural Bridge and Fairyland.
Zion is great too but honestly if you could only visit one of them I would pick Bryce over Zion."

The canyon itself can be seen almost entirely from the comforts of the car . There is an 18 mile scenic drive which take you to all of the points. Our favorites were Inspiration Point, Natural Bridge, Ponderosa , and Bryce Point. This drive took us 3-4 hours with plenty of photo stops and short hikes along the rim.
Even though you can see the park by car, we highly recommend taking at least a couple of hikes along the well maintained trails. Some suggestions if you are short on time like us :
1. Navajo trail ( our favorite): moderate, at least see the first few sections and switchbacks.
2. Rim trail : easy
3. Queens Garden : easiest descent into the canyon, but we liked the Navajo descent more.
Navajo and Queens Garden can be combined to do a loop.
The highlight of the trip was the night sky . We cannot recommend this enough. Please go to one of the points , and just look up. You will see the glorious milky way and a million stars.
All in all, we highly recommend this park."

Thee Visitor Centre will give you directions to get the best of your time here. There are ranger programs.

I felt so lucky that I was able to attend an astronomy program after dark at the lodge and then do a telescope viewing of our planets and galaxies at Sunset Point. The rangers were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable during this. I could have talked to them all night. We also especially loved the rangers directing traffic at the visitors center.

It's just a couple hours drive from Zion via the beautiful Hwy 9 Zion Scenic Drive and Hwy 89, with so many winding roads and unbelievable views of Zion NP. Don't forget to take some pictures with a couples of drive-thru Arches before reaching Bryce Canyon NP entrance.
There are 4 main viewpoints: Bryce point, Inspiration point, Sunset point and Rainbow Point. IMO, a MUST SEE are Bryce Point and Rainbow Point.
- At the Bryce Point you can view the famous Bryce Amphitheater (it carries the park's name, so most of the highlights are here), whereas countless spires of rock columns also called Hoodoos that carved into the canyon, they formed into an unbelievable views, an unbelievable place on earth. So unique and mind-boggling.
- Rainbow Point is the last viewpoint of the park, it's also at the highest elevation (9,115' to be exact). The panoramic view of the whole Bryce canyon is here. It's just BREATHTAKING. Trust me. You don't want to miss this.
- FYI, if you like to hike, there are trails in each viewpoint, they also have trails that connect between viewpoint, ranging from easy to moderate. Spend at least a day at the park to enjoy all the best that Mother Nature has given us.
Hope this review will help you with some basic info. Now, go explore and enjoy one of the Mighty Five."

Once back at the visitors center, there is a shuttle that will take you to the parts you can't see by car, and the run frequently.
The vistas a views are literally other-worldly. If you want to know what a canyon would look like on anther planet, you don't need to imagine it, as you can see one of Mother Nature's true spectacles, right here on Earth.

Not just another red rock canyon. Unusual spires. The Rim area is great, but I thought the Navajo Trial was very rewarding for a little effort.

Arriving in late afternoon, we started our experience at Bryce with the Mossy Cave hike and a visit to Fairyland. The following day to get a scope of the park, we did the 18 mile scenic view points, and the Ampitheatre (Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise, and Bryce Points). The next morning, when crowds were low, we did the Wall Street hike from Sunset Point to the Queens Garden, up to Sunrise Point, and back to Sunset. We followed this with a sunset hike from Sunset Point, down Wall Street, and did the Navajo Loop. The incredible formations, Thor's Hammer and the 3 Sisters, can be viewed at the end of this loop. We highly recommend the Rustler's Restaurant in Tropic. Not only is the food great, but owner, Dallas Clark, is the first genuine cowboy that we have met.

Spend some time, especially at sunrise and sunset to view the changing light and colors on the hoodoos. Bryce Canyon is famous for its worldly unique geology. The erosional force of frost-wedging and the dissolving power of rainwater have shaped the colorful limestone rock of the Claron Formation into bizarre shapes including slot canyons, windows, fins, and spires called “hoodoos.” When we were there we took a horseback ride into the bottom of the canyon. Fabulous! We stayed in the historic cabins close to the rim. Highly recommend!"

You can see all viewpoints by jumping on the shuttle bus so everything is possible with your kids. The only walk which is accesible with the stroller is between sunset and sunrise they say. But we did Queens garden, Navajo loop and sunset to inspiration point with the stroller as well. Sometimes a bit steep and stoney but as far as we’re concerned it was good (make sure you take the 2 bridges side of Navajo, we did the other side and than you do have to carry the last couple of hundred meters).

She really wanted to go hike through the hoodoos! (Those are the pillar looking rock formations)
This park and generally all of the NP's we visited while in Utah, was kind of small. Not sure exactly how big but I think from.the entrance to the end, it was like 18 miles?
First day we arrived, we took a ride all the way to the end and made our way back out. We didn't hike that day, just drove and stopped and took pictures.
The next day we hiked! We did the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail, through Wall St. What an incredible park this is. The views were other worldly. Just like at Zion NP, Bryce has some switchbacks. Make sure you bring some snacks and plenty of fluids with. Even being in the canyon, it gets warm out there.
Parts of the Queens Garden Trail went through the rock! They cut out little tunnels for you to go through. It was a really awesome place to hike. Probably our favorite.
We went down another trail, not sure of the name, but it took you past Thor's Hammer and other sites. We were dog tired by that point. Make sure to pay attention to the elevation gain for which ever trail you're doing.
A good thing to do is to check in at the welcome center and talk with the rangers. They will give you valuable information.
All in all, can't wait to go back!"

We went during the day and it was pretty hot, but if you bring plenty of water and good shoes, you will be so enchanted.

There are so many different and varied hikes available, you will be busy for a long time just figuring out which hike to enjoy next.
During the summer season Bryce does get crowded. Not as bad as Zion or Yosemite, but still very crowded. If you aren’t camping in the park, the really is no reason to fight the crowded parking lots found at the vistas and trailheads. An excellent bus shuttle system runs throughout the park and will get you anywhere you need to go. Park outside the park and hop on the shuttle, this saving your patience and preserving your peace of mind.
Fabulous pizza by the slice at the General Store. Huge and affordable , one slice is enough. Enjoy!"

We already had a National Parks annual pass so it did not cost us to get in or park. The pass costs $80 but well worth it if you plan to visit several of them. We dropped into the visitor centre but had already been given maps so quickly headed out to catch the free shuttle. You don’t have to do this but parking and navigating in the amphitheater can be difficult at peak times. We hopped off the bus at sunrise & walked the hoodoos to sunset point. It’s spectacular but can be hot so take water,suncream etc. We were limited in time but there are other trails that you can do. We then went back to the van for lunch before setting off on the scenic drive. We opted to drive to the furthest point & stop at the view points on the way back as it was easier to turn in/out.
Best advice is to get there early & do any walking while still cool."

You can drive through the park there is a nice paved road. I suggest that when entering the park drive right up to the end which is Yovimpa point. Reason for this is that the viewpoints are all to your right when driving down, so much easier to park your car. Each viewpoint is worth a stop as all are differend. The park is full of Hoodoos which are pinkish limestone columns. There are hiking trails, some accompanied by rangers to go down into the park. The one I liked most was the
""Queen's Garden"" (hoodoo like a statue of Queen Victoria.)
Most of the walks from one viewpoint to another are proteced with fence but there
are still some areas which are not. Be careful and don't go too near the edge."

Seeing all the glorious colors of the hoodoos is like no other place I've ever seen. Get there early in the summer to beat the crowds, even before the park officially opens, you can get in. Inspiration Point is amazing - do the walk to the point. The hike at Sunset Point Overlook is awesome. You travel down into the canyon and will walk between the huge red rock into what appears to be like a slot canyon. You'll then walk out of the more narrow area onto a trail that traverses through part of the canyon's floor and then takes you back up to Sunset Point again. Note, bring water; wear tennis shoes at the least, and if you are not used to climbing any elevation, just take it slowly. You'll get there. It's not a hard hike; just coming back up will give you some elevation. Lots of overlooks in the park and lots of trails if you have more time. Amazing place!"

Amazing views!
We have always stayed on the rim trail and saw it from the top in the past. This visit we hiked the Navajo trail down in the canyon and loved it!
The Navajo trail is just little over a one mile hike. So glad we did it. We were worried about the hike out of the canyon but it was not as bad as we thought. We went down on the Wall Street side and went up on the other side. The switch backs can be challenging however for 2 people not in excellent shape that are 51 & 60 it was not all that bad.
The views were totally different than from above and not at all what we expected. We were so glad we did this hike! Make sure to where comfortable walking shoes. Water might be needed on a hot day. The breeze in the canyon was great when we were there and the temp was 82 in mid August. Excellent weather for this hike. We barely broke a sweat."

Even my teenagers were struck speechless for a while! Advice is to go as early as you can to beat the crowds and the heat of the day. We arrived 9am.. drive to Sunset Point, walk North along the rim to Sunrise point & then follow the trail
downwards. Whole thing takes just over an hour if you take it slowly.
It’s a gentle slope down with stunning views. The reason to do the loop this way around is that it is easier to climb up a steep slope than to walk down down it. At the end of the loop you get 2 options.. zone to to climb back up to the right and the other is to go left towards Wall Street. Do this one! It’s steep but in the shade and stunning! Our sins did the other route since it was slightly shorter but they said it was sunny. No words describe how stunning this place is... here are some photos.
Then drive along the very end of the park, Yovimba point. Don’t. Other stopping stand if the vistas on the way there; save that for the trip back when they’re all in the right hand side, so much easier to drive in and out of. It’s stunning!"

Tips : The car park at the end of the road through the Park gets very busy and this was the only real bottleneck. Choose a quieter time. We found it better to drive straight there and then work our way back through all the scenic stop off points.
The treks are a lot easier than we anticipated before we got there. We did the busy Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trail followed by the Tower Bridge trail which was much quieter. Park in the Sunset Car Park and take the stunning short walk to Sunrise Point to start either trek. The treks are amazing, a real lifetime experience.
I would recommend taking picnics with you. Food in the Park is not great.
Check the weather as lightening can be quite dangerous. We saw a number of strikes around the top of the rim which, whilst spectacular, were quite scary.
Well marked stop off points give you good views, many of which are surprisingly different.
Bryce Visitor Centre is extremely busy and the car park is a nightmare. Lots of unsupervised, over-excited children made it quite dangerous. Worth going to however as the Rangers are extremely helpful."

Start early and stay out as long as possible. Stop at the visitor's center to get some ideas of what to see and do.
If you plan to hike down and up, be prepared. Plenty of water, hat, sunscreen, snacks, fan, light jacket, and good shoes. Make sure you plan time for it, as you want to enjoy the experience and look around and not just run up and down.

No photos do this place justice. Pulling up to the visitor centre you feel like you are in a fairytale wilderness as wild deer roam the grasslands. Then the first time you look over 'the rim' to the hoodoos below - Mother Nature certainly carved a work of art!
Would suggest driving all the way to the furthest point, Rainbow Point, and call in on a handful of vantage points on your way back (all are on your right on the way back). Finish off at Sunrise or Sunset point at the end of the day to see the sun falling below the horizon.
We walked part of the Queen's Garden Trail early one morning. Rated as one of the less strenuous hikes, if you are not reasonably fit you will find the hike back up quite hard. Go early in the morning and take plenty of water."

We went to the last stop the shuttle makes first and then worked out way back. In hindsight we should have started with the first shuttle stop and then gone forward because by the time we got there, there was no parking.

Every view point has a slightly different view & the colors are amazing! I highly recommend ""hiking the hoodoos"" - it gives you a greater appreciation for Bryce. We hiked in at Sunset point & out at Sunrise point (this meant that the hiking back up was a little less intense). It was about 3-miles round trip (including the rim walk back from Sunrise point to Sunset point) and we did it with our two kids (ages 7 & 10). It took a little bit more encouragement to get the 7-year old back up to the rim, but they both made it! And we got cool stickers at the Visitor's Center when we showed them our pictures of us & the little ""Hike the Hoodoos"" medallions down in the canyon. Be sure to carry water & wear hiking clothes! Parking gets pretty full at some of the main sights, so you might want to enter the park earlier in the day or may later in the day. That being said, many of the viewpoints still had room to make our quick pull-ins & pull-outs. We spent the better part of the morning here, but we could easily have spent a lot longer!"

There are a half dozen hikes in each of the easy, moderate and strenuous categories just in and around the amphitheater alone, ranging from 1 mile to 8. And there are multi-day backcountry hikes as well as horseback options. And if all you can do is walk or ride a wheelchair around the paved part of the rim trail, you will count it amongs life's great experiences. At night the sky is so dark you will be blown away by how much you can see.
I recommend starting at the Visitors Center and planning your day by viewing the scale topo model of the park. It's a much better preview than consulting a map since you can actually see the terrain you'll be hiking through."

The brillant colors of pink, gray, white, chocolate cliffs were a sight to see. The hoodoo delicate formations throughout Bryce is fascinating. We took a shuttle from visitor center to Bryce Point #3 - oh what a view. we walked 2 miles to Inspiration Point #4. As you walk from each point the views keeping changing magically to reshape what you just viewed a few steps away. Then we took the shuttle to #6 and walked a mile to #8 Sunset Point, again viewing different angles of the hoodoo and spirals. The hoodoos keep breaking off and new ones begin. The colors are magnificent and breathtaking.. After we finished seeing all the four points we waited to take a free ranger tour at 1:30. This is a three hour tour our ranger guide Randy, was awesome.
you can register for a free tour guide up to 7 days before you arrive and make an appointment either at 9:00 am or 1:30 pm. They only take 40 people so you can imagine it fills up quickly. I just called 7 days ahead and made the appointment.
Here is where he took us: Rainbow Point, Yovimpa Point where Randy explained each stop with passion. Then he took us to Aqua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Faiirview Point, again just explaining the beauty of the Hoodoos. He took us to Fairyland Point where he showed us Snoopy sleeping on the Hoodoo. Actually you can give names to any Hoodoo and call it as you see it. I recommend taking this tour but register 7 days ahead to assure a sit."

We rented a house just outside the Park entrance (10 minutes from the Visitor Center), and it was convenient and relaxing to enter the Park each day and see the sites.
There were a couple of accessible walks for young children and family members with limited mobility, and there was a fairly easy walk that led down into the Canyon for unique photographs.
There are a couple of different options in the park for meals, and there are also restaurants within 10 - 20 minutes from the Park entrance. The general store has a surprisingly large selection (food, hiking and first aid supplies, souvenirs, etc.) and bathrooms are easy to find throughout the park (helpful with kids).
We found Bryce to be a much more pleasant experience than Zion Canyon -- not as crowded, easier to get around in the Park (no shuttle needed), more variety of hikes/walks for people with different fitness levels, and not as hot in July. We would love to return.
We spent 2 days and could have spent longer.
Only suggestion would be for Rangers to set up / host designated dark areas for people to gather for stargazing (away from the Visitor Center)."

The National park is extremely well run. There is no access to the many view points into the canyon for RVs, but you can park up and there is an efficient hop-on, hop-off bus service that runs a route around these vistas. Buses come every 10-minutes or so.

Go early to avoid people. You can earn a free park sticker at the visitors center if you take a selfie in front of the hoodoo boards marked throughout the park. Ask for details when you arrive. It is a good way to keep kids motivated to hike!
Lunch at Bryce Lodge is a good idea, but service is sketchy. If you get the right server, you are in luck.Tasty lunch buffet.

There are the ubiquitous red and white sandstone cliffs, but at Bryce they are wind and water sculpted into fantastic shapes and towers. After visiting the visitor center and speaking to a ranger, park your car and take the free shuttle; they are easy, convenient and allow you to take in the scenery. As a plus, the drivers are a wealth of knowledge they gladly share. Based on our conversation with the bus driver, we decided to hike the Rim Trail from Inspiration Point past Sunset Point to Sunrise Point. We then hiked into the canyon by the Queen's Garden Trail to Navajo Loop (Wall Street side, Two Bridges was closed). Hiking in that direction, as suggested by the visitor center ranger, we were mostly in the sun for the walk down into the canyon but had some shade on the way out. It is a moderate hike, around 4 miles, that took us (a 60-ish couple with bad feet and knees and 3 others around 30 year olds) several hours, but we were in no hurry and there is a lot to look at. You are walking down into the canyon (and then up and out) so there are some high areas, which doesn't thrill me, but they were manageable, and the payoff scenery was more than worth it. As you approach the switchback ascent from the canyon, enjoy the coolness, literally and figuratively, of Wall Street. Be sure to bring plenty of water and some insect repellent. If you are coming to Bryce via Rt 14 from Cedar City, be advised there is a stretch of road that is narrow, twisty and has sheer and often guard rail-less drop-offs. Bryce seemed much less crowded than Zion and different than anyplace you've ever been in the US."

It's breathtaking. So many natural wonders. The trails are well-marked. The park offers a shuttle service that picks up every 15 minutes at each of the trail entrances so if you had limited time or wanted to hike a portion of a trail rather than all of it, this will definitely come in handy.

Still snow on the ground in late May so even more picturesque.
The Visitor Centre was brilliant though they did tell us everything was open yet the Navajo Trail was closed.
Forget the shuttle and drive yourself, otherwise you’ll miss half of the park. The regular shuttle doesn’t go all the way to Rainbow Point so there are no hordes from ‘you know where’ shoving you out of the way to take their selfies.
We did think that $35 for the day was expensive. Sure you could come back again but there’s no need. It’s not Yellowstone.
The very small car park at Bryce Point was manned by a couple of thugs who wouldn’t let you reverse nor wait for us to get in our car to let another car into our space. Were they trained to be unpleasant, did they miss being in the military or was it just a requirement of the job?

We spent the entire day in the park and probably should have spent two. The trip through Red Canyon was a great start to the morning. Once entering the park, (we started out on a crisp morning - 43 degrees and high winds, which we were not prepared for), we headed up to the bristlecone pine forest. At an elevation of 9100+ feet we could feel the altitude difference. There are trees in this part of the park that are reportedly more than 4000 years old.
We worked our way back down, taking in all the turnouts along the way. The views are spectacular throughout the entire park. We actually tackled the tougher trails on horseback (Peekaboo, etc.) which was a great way to see the park. Because horse trails and human trails often intersect, our trail guides were frequently redirecting people back on to the correct trails. I could see if you were not paying attention how you could get turned around on certain hikes.
Only regret is not seeing the park at dusk or dawn."

Some advice; this is a High Elevation event - therefore, some people may feel the results of the added pressure and height phobias. It WILL be cooler than the starting elevation - so a jacket may be helpful. There will also likely be a breeze or wind - so hold on to your hat. NIKE this one (Just Do It)!"

They are all fab...with Bryce being amongst our favs!!
We stayed at the Best Western Ruby Inn (try priceline to get the best rates)...the folks ahead of us paid $204, the folks behind us paid $89, and we paid $92...ofcourse the latter two were priceline.
Get the $80 annual pass...the other 4 state parks are exceptional as well and the pass lets you in all (Zion is just under 2 hours away).
You can drive Bryce yourself or take the shuttle...we did a combo of both which I preferred.
Plan atleast spend a full day here...starting at 7am will get you well ahead of traffic...take a break around 1, then head back at 7pm for a sunset hike. Or start around 4 and go straight through to nightfall.
Views and hikes gallore! Not to be missed."

Viewed from Inspiration Point on a clear day with snow still crusting the canyon rim, the vibrant orange/pink colours of the hoodoos scream at you to lean over and look deep down into the canyon floor to see where they begin. It’s as if you are looking down at New York skyscrapers from a drone camera high above. Luckily there is one small section of wall to lean into as you do this. I found myself calling out to three teenagers doing star jumps near the edge in a bid to get action shots. The path around the edge Is well defined but mostly unfenced. Locals tell you there are fifty deaths a year in canyons across the country. But for me it’s a must visit. A spectacle of rock and space and colour you cant forget."

Although the others are beautiful and awesome in their own ways, we found Bryce to be unique. The hiking trails, the overlooks, the change in the terrain around every corner were just so striking.
We visited the last week of June and it was quite crowded, but the temperatures were perfect - especially at the higher altitudes. Go early in the day to avoid some of the crowds. There are so many places to hike and enjoy views, that the people were dispersed over multiple areas and were not a hindrance.

These monoliths tower above you as you walk through the loop trails (or you can look down from above if you do not feel able to undertake the hikes).

I know the Hoodoo hike is not to be missed, but, sadly, it'll have to wait for another day for us. The shuttle service worked very well and you can park at the shuttle station outside of the park and be just fine.

The hoodoos are amazing. The word means ""stone men"" in a First Nations language.
The altitude may bother you, so go slowly and drink lots of water. The upside is it's much cooler here than Zion or Moab or Vegas.
If you can, hike below the rim. My husband did the Queen's Garden trail and loved it. If you are like me and can't hike well, sign up for the horseback/mule ride into the canyon. That was a great value for us, and lets you see things from a different angle."

Unlike Zion or Capitol Reef, where you are always looking up, in Bryce you look down - from four basic vista view points - much like Canyonlands. It also requires minimal walking. This is called the largest concentration of hoodoo formations anywhere on earth. We found this park very easy to navigate, as there are four basic vista view points. We took advantage of their bus service, which we found timely and very convenient, although you can drive in this park. The bus picked us up at our Best Western hotel and made a loop through the park; you need your park pass to get on the bus. It drops you off at several spots in the park, most notable the four view points and the visitor center. Be sure to see the introductory movie in the center. You'll see unbelievable sights at Bryce!"

We flew in/out of Las Vegas as it was easier to get back there from Arizona, where we were ending our trip, to return our rental car. The four hour drive to Bryce was nice and easy, getting particularly scenic once we got on U.S. 89, and especially so on Scenic Byway 12. We based at a mom-n-pops motel (Bryce Canyon Pines Motel; recommend it; see my TripAdvisor review) located right on 12 and around 5-10 minutes from the park. We liked it and would definitely stay there again, as it is very convenient to the park, yet away from the cluster of other lodging establishments, and has a wonderful onsite restaurant. The park itself, with its unique rock formations and magical hoodoos should be on everyone’s list of “must-visit” places. It has a nice intimate feel, as it is Utah’s smallest national park, and one of the smallest national parks in our entire country, yet it is full of its own otherworldly grandeur. While at Bryce, we hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail, which is below the canyon rim, and also hiked the Rim Trail, from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Both are definitely ones to consider. We were going to do the Peekaboo Loop Trail too, but since we took the three hour mule ride with Canyon Trail Rides (also reviewed on TripAdvisor; definite attraction to consider if you have the time) that is on the same trail, we decided not to hike it as well. We also drove to Rainbow Point, the park’s highest point at over 9,000 ft. You can see the Natural Bridge along the way, so it’s worth the short ride up. It was actually snowing that day, making it all the more interesting for us Floridians. The park was very organized, both from the Visitor’s Center to the shuttle bus system; all easy to understand and navigate, and made even more so by the friendly park rangers on duty. They say to make sure to start by going into the Visitor’s Center, and you should, regardless of how much advance research you may do. We feel four nights at Bryce is just enough, at least it was for us. It also gave us time to explore a bit of the surrounding area, which is as beautiful as the canyon and park. This included some window shopping in Panguitch, a nearby town; the red rocks of Red Canyon (very cool); and additional driving on Scenic Byway 12, where we continued to the suggested overlook at mile marker 70. We can see why it is recommended."

I've never visited during the height of summer vacation season. I tried parking at the visitor center on my way in and there wasn't a space to be found. So I drove the main road all the way to the end and stopped at each vista on the way back towards the entrance. Most had parking available, however, Bryce Point, in particular, was quite challenging. On my first attempt, no parking spaces were open. There are 2 guards at the parking lot entrance and cones that prevent you from reentering the parking lot. I needed to drive a mile down the road and turn around to come back. On my second attempt, I found a spot. The guards made it clear that I couldn't even use my brakes to slow down in the lot to wait for someone to back out. I had to leave and drive a mile and return. The vista was spectacular and quite crowded. The Japanese tourists were the only ones going beyond the railings next to the crumbling cliff edge to get photos. All others were respectful of the boundaries. On my way out it was nearing dinner time and I stopped to walk through the lodge and see if I could park at the visitor center. I was able to find a spot."

Inspiration Point is an amazing wall of stone that appears to cut out and painted.
Have not seen anything like this anywhere I’ve traveled. You can park in town and take a free shuttle bus into the National Park. You need to have your park pass to get on the shuttle. It makes about 8 stops along a route that takes you to a number of scenic points and the visitor’s center. You can get off at any stop and the next shuttle will pick you up in 10-15 minutes.

And it did not disappoint. We are not hikers or backpackers. We elected to just drive the 18 mile scenic road and stop and everyone of the overlooks. Though you are actually looking at the same canyon, each stop gave a different perspective and was a beauty at each view. The most exhilarating was Inspiration Point which happens to be the first top. You do have a drive a bit to get to it but GO!!! It is breathtaking! The visitor center was consistently quite busy. Plenty of parking and they do offer a shuttle service though not sure how that runs. We observed them on the road and believe that once they will up, they stay with that group going up and back down, which seems to make the best sense (vs. Zion that has a continually looping shuttle service on the main road)."

My wife & I parked our motorhome at a designated lot near the park entrance where we boarded a convenient shuttle bus that took us to the rustic park lodge. Once in the park, hop-on-hop-off shuttle buses made it easy to travel around the park to see the various vistas. Hiking trails along the top of the canyon provide spectacular views of this enormous canyon. Bryce Canyon's vastness, depth, irregular contours, literally tens of thousand of hoodoos make it singularly beautiful and unique. The trails down into the canyon are steep and potentially very treacherous, These sloping trails descending into the bottom of the canyon are narrow, often less than 8 ft wide with no handrails so parents with toddlers and young adventuresome free spirited children will have to hold hands because their is no room for an accidental fall without rolling down steep slopes hundreds of feet below. The hikes down to the bottom will take an hour or two so each person should take a full quart of water. Even the healthiest hikers are not immune to heatstroke. Also the climb back up will be harder than the descent so factor that into the equation. But the views are spectacular and surrealistic. Bryce is unforgettable."

As we sat on the shuttle bus we were in awh of this incredible place.
I would suggest when you first get to the park to go to the visitor center look at the events board that shows what ranger talks are happening on which days and times, what trails are closed, and the weather report. See what interest you and put together a plan to get the most out of your time at Bryce.
For us, we checked the visitor center, talked to a ranger about trails and ranger’s recommendations. We road the shuttle all the way to the end and then got off each stop to get an overview and photos. The bus comes by every 10-15 minutes. We chose 2 hikes: Peek-A-Boo to Queens , A Must Do! (To walk amongst the hoodos is amazing.) and Fairyland (the short version to Tower Bridge) and and a mountain bike ride: Thunder Mountain, we saw the short film at visitor center which was good, attended a presentation about the stars/galaxies and then went to the Telescope viewing which was excellent. Stars and galaxies are unbelievable abundant.
Even if you are not fit to do a whole hike- try to go part way to see what you can, it will empower you to see the beauty a little closer than from the vistas.
A must see in your lifetime."

They are best seen from hiking trails that go from the rim down into the valley and back up. The altitude is about 8,000 feet at the rim. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen and wear good shoes. Hiking poles were very helpful for me (fit but age 69). The major trails are 6-8 miles long, so start in the morning.

The road stops at every vantage point and if you are not into hiking you can still see the best of the park from these stops. I had wanted to walk the Navajo Trail into the Canyon but unfortunately this was closed due to damage from the severe snow of the season. Repairs were underway but regrettably not completed at the time of our visit. Moving along the road to higher elevations we came across snow which was much fun and very unexpected in mid May. Coming from tropical Australia it was such a wonderful experience. This park was absolutely amazing and a standout of all the parks we visited. The visitor centre staff were extremely helpful and had a great range in the gift shop. Will definitely put this Bryce Canyon back on the itinerary if we are lucky enough to return in the future.

Hiking and photographing in Bryce Canyon is a lifetime experience ...each day with this small group of 6 opened up every vantage point you could wish for in a place of such natural beauty. We had an added bonus of arriving at Sunrise Point the next morning to have it in snow so nothing short of amazing . The rim walk is also a must but you can join at different points along the way and there is a shuttle . Could have stayed here longer ...the reds, oranges and rock formations blew my mind and add the snow the next day and it was pure bliss.

Yeah sure grandma.... then I went there and now I get it. This place honestly changed my life. We started the day at sunrise at sunrise point, a crystal clear morning saw the sun crest over the mountains and light up the hoodoos in a magical red and pink glow. We hiked down the queens garden trail, all the way to the cross with Navajo loop which was closed and then hiked out on the peak-a-boo trail. It was hard, hiking into, through and back out of the canyon but even though we were tired i could not get enough of the pink and orange hoodoos against a deep blue sky. When you see this place in the glow of the sunlight you won't believe it's real, you have to see it in person.

We experienced a cold front, snow, sleet, rain, hail, and white-out driving. It was fairly cold the two days we were here. When the sun came out we were able to feel what the Utah son can do for warmth so that was a nice respite. We stayed in traffic and the commute to Bryce was about 25 minutes which was not terrible and had great views of its own but it was difficult when we were driving through storms because there’s ups and downs and turns a lot. We were able to see a Clear view at Bryce Canyon from sunrise pointe later in the afternoon after some storms had cleared but we only got about 3 1/2 hours of clarity before another storm rolled in which was much heavier than the first one resulting in 6 inches of snow overnight. We were glad we bit off a lot of hiking that first day because the second day a lot of things were closed due to the storm that had happened. Because of the storm we were not able to do the scenic drive down the rest of Bryce Canyon.Honestly we did almost 4 hours of hiking the first day and saw everything from the depths of the canyon all the way to the top with sunset views and didn’t really feel like we missed anything with the scenic drive so it was fine with us."

It would appear that everything shuts down by 9 and the restaurants choice of food is not of a high quality. Many will eat at Ruby's inn where when the bill arrives they have already added 18% gratuity , but also give you the option to tip again! Considering many of the quests are foreign travellers, wonder how many get caught out on this!!
I have been told the area is owned by one family hence the lack of variety! Compared to the options available at Zion it really is dismal and needs a major improvement!!
My advice is visit the beautiful canyon but stay at Zion!!
Zion has much more variety and you can enjoy the whole day/night there!
On our recent visit stayed at the Marriott Spring Hill suites,Springdale. lovely hotel, hence the price, however appalling breakfast, very limited food options served on paper plates and plastic utensils!! Awaiting for their response!!"

We were not disappointed. Bryce Canyon was amazing, a photographer's dream. The weather was beautiful the views were amazing. The trails were alot of fun, esp. for the boys. The only draw back was that quite a few of the trails were closed when we were there due to muddy conditions. I understand because they still had snow on the ground in spots. I will say though if you have small children that like to run around bring a rope to tie around them. Although the views are amazing, there aren't many guard rails on the trails, esp. the Sunrise to Sunset. I was on edge as were others, so just be careful. I really don't think there is any place like it. Book early if you want to stay in the park and go check out the views at night from the top. I hope to definitely go back some day."

I did one hike down into the canyon - Queens Garden (few others were open yet in mid-April). It sure looks steep going down, but somehow coming back up was not as awful as I expected it to be. Very worthwhile. The rim trail and viewpoints were all very worthwhile.
I tried to go out specifically for sunset and sunrise. In case it helps anyone else, note that the canyon aspect pushes back sunrise and pushes *forward* sunset viewing times. If sunrise, astronomically, is 7am, then the light in the canyon (coming over the edge of the canyon and down into the hoodoos) won't really get going until closer to 7:30am. Likewise, if sunset is 7pm, arriving at 6:30pm is too late - the canyon will already be out of light as the sun will have gone over the horizon of the canyon well before true sunset time. So take that into account and maybe you will have better luck than I did! (Or get some more time in bed before sunrise...)"

We went there this past March for spring break, and after a VERY long drive, we got there, and unfortunatley the park ranger (they are usually so helpful at these parks, because we go to them all of the time) DID NOT tell us that most of the park was closed due to snowfall. We paid the entrance fee, only to drive to the first stop in the park, and we couldn't go any farther. I felt like we should have received a refund. Bryce is off the beaten track, and one would like to enjoy the majority of the park when going there. I understand snow and other natural obstacles, but it would have been nice of the ranger to notify us of this situation so we could have made the decision to spend the money on the entrance fee at the time of entering. Not happy. We also, from what we did get to see, loved Zion SO MUCH MORE!

The entire experience was a huge gift of time to share with her.
This year I was blessed with the gift of going with my 81 year old father as visiting had been on his bucket list for years.
I had a totally different experience and it was still wonderful. We were there two days. The first day we watched the introductory movie at the visitors center, which was interesting, took the shuttle, and slowly walked the rim trail. The weather was perfect during the last week of April. While waiting for the shuttle we were informed that there is also a free three hour tour twice a day from the shuttle service. We decided to take it the next day and were so glad we did! The driver was knowledgeable and fun and we made it to every stop. There were many snow people and even a turtle that had been created at the top! The views were phenomenal and using binoculars, we were able to even spot the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and Zion! I highly recommend it, the Rainbow Tour."

The first day we took the Queens trail and the did a circle loop on Peek a boo since Navajo was closed.
It was a nice day and even for April there seemed to be a good number of tourists.
It’s hoodoo heaven out there on the trail!
Thor’s hammer is visible from Sunset point or the Navajo loop, if you’re looking for it. Bucky asked everyone we met about it, so put your mind at ease...it’s still there!
The next day we hiked the Fairyland trail which takes you past Tower Bridge. There were far fewer hikers and the trail was more scenic, but it is an 8 mile loop!
We had a couple days of great hiking and got lots of great photos.
It is a National Park that should not be missed if you are in Utah."

This takes you to the northern entrance of Bryce Canyon National Park.
Bryce Canyon National Park is not a canyon, but a giant natural amphitheater.
The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a national monument 1923, and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928.
Bryce Amphitheater, the first three miles of the park, has the most iconic and popular views of Bryce, Sunrise, Sunset, and Inspiration Points.
When you enter the park at the Fee Station, you will be given a park map. This shows the locations, distances, and elevations of the viewpoints, trailheads, restrooms and whatever else you will need.
Parking is ample and free and you have a choice between the free park shuttle bus, which is NOT mandatory, or driving yourself.
Trailheads for the Under the Rim trail, Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration Points the Navajo Loop Trail, and the Queen's Garden all begin near here. At certain times, announced ranger led talks and hikes will begin here as well. You can also participate in the Dark Ranger Night Sky programs.
While some park roads are closed in the winter, the park itself is open. Camping is available with sites by reservation, and lodging is at the Bryce Canyon Lodge, also by reservation, and well ahead of the date. Bryce Canyon Lodge also features a nice restaurant."

The reality is even better. We visited in April, so there was still some snow around and there was a risk of storms. It also meant that the road to Rainbow Point was closed at Natural Bridge and that many of the trails were closed. We were glad we took advantage of the afternoon we arrived to visit a few of the sights and walk part of the Rim Trail because that night a wind and snow storm blew in. There wasn’t much snow, but the wind was very strong and very cold. Although we made a few attempts at venturing out, the weather was too much for us. The next morning was very cold with some wind, especially on the points, but we were able to get to some amazing vistas and to do some hiking on the Queen’s Garden Trail. Even losing a day to the bad weather, we were glad that we stopped in Bryce and will return. One suggestion: Stay in the park, if you can. The Bryce Canyon Lodge has walking access to the Amphitheater and the Rim Trail. Weather willing, that let’s you get just about everywhere, depending on how far you want to walk or hike. It also avoids the lines at the park entrance. They aren’t as bad as Arches and Zion but waiting in line is not the best way to start your day."

So the next morning we, we were in line before 0800AM at the Shuttle stop at Ruby’s, to see if we can get on the 0900AM tour. Fortunately, there were seats! So we left our car at the parking lot—no charge, loaded on the bus and enjoyed a very informative tour for 3 hours! Again—no charge, except for the park entrance fee. After this tour, we boarded the another free shuttle that stops at all the park’s sites and walked on the trails. The shuttles came very frequently and waiting was never an issue. The Whodoos were spectacular!!! We were impressed—no stress to find parking and getting more information by the shuttle drivers about the park! Thank you very much for allowing us to experience a first rate park!!!"

Yes, it does not have the vast grandeur of the Grand Canyon, but it offers you a whole lot more details of truly outstanding rock formations. Even if you are just driving through, the views at Sunset Point and the Rim Trail are already well worth the trip. If you have more time (and energy) try some of the trails. The Queens Garden is a great initial hike. They classify it as an easy hike. However, it is not easy at all if you are out of shape. The trip to the garden is mostly downhill, so the return trip is were it gets hard.
Photo Tip: Get your selfies on the return trip. You can get down to the garden without a whole lot of rest, then spend some time at the end of the switchbacks on your way back. Excellent time for selfies, while you can your breath."

Finally we hiked down from Sunrise point to the Queens Garden (trail), between the rocks and little tunnels dug out,a s that was the only trail open that would get us between the hoodoos.

We recently hosted two professional geologists from the Peoples Republic of China on a tour of Bryce National Park. To witness their excitement and amazement and to hear their repeated, ""I have never even heard of a place like this before!"" cemented forever just how amazing this park is.
If you can possibly make it to this world treasure, DO!
You will remember it with joy forever."

This place is awesome! We didn't realize driving in that there's actually another visitor center when you turn off of 89 onto 12, called Red Canyon Visitor Center. We stopped there and they had some great pamphlets on the area, camping spots and the scenic byway. To be fair I didn't check if they had the same pamphlets at Bryce Canyon visitor center or not. We visited April 7th and while weather changes year to year note that due to snow they still had part of the road closed and we weren't able to hike down to the hoodoos. That said, even the hike on the rim from sunset point to inspriation point provided tons of simply amazing views!"

It left me speechless and continued to amaze me at every view. The staff at the visitors center is incredibly helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Use their advice to guide you to appropriate trails. Maps and information abounds here. Take a ranger guided excursion - - there is so much to learn. Ranger Todd took us ( adults, senior citizens and children) on an amazing tour to the delight of all in attendance. He was incredibly engaging so much so that even the youngest were attentive. We all looked at the park, its geology, plants and animals with much greater appreciation after listening to Ranger Todd. He was excellent!! We took the free Rainbow Shuttle tour with Randy our driver. Randy has an amazing amount of knowledge of the park and at each stop along the way he shared his experience with us. The Rainbow Shuttle is such a bonus and it's free! This treasure belongs to all Americans; don't miss it. Wonderful in every way."

If you want an easy hike go to Sunrise Point and walk to Sunset Point - it is an easy stroll with lots of benches along the way to sit and admire the views. We hiked the Queens Trail which is easy to moderate. Remember it takes twice as long to hike back up as it does down. Not ideal for young children as there are a few narrow bits and some serious drops. However, if you are reasonably fit you won’t have any trouble and it is really worth the effort. There are several more strenuous trails although some of them are closed at present due to snow and rock fall. It costs $35 per car (regardless of how many occupants) which lasts for 7 days and it is worth every penny. Don’t miss it - it makes you glad to be alive!!!!!"

Almost all of the trails were closed (only the rim trail was open inside the park, and one trail outside of the park) and the main road was only open about 2 miles.
While we were disappointed that we couldn't do the hikes we had planned, we had an amazing time! We signed up for the guided snowshoe hike in the visitors center, and it essentially saved our trip! ;) It was amazing. We had so much fun, back in the quiet and still woods, snowshoe hiking to the rim. Our ranger was amazing, especially with our kids (ages 14, 13, 9, 7) questions.
We also walked/hiked the rim trail. It was snowy, and slippery in spots, but we were still able to enjoy it."

It was also the only spot where it snowed and where there was much snow on the ground. Indeed, the hiking trails leading from the rim of the canyon (really an amphitheater) to the bottom were closed due to previous snowfall. Actually, the snow was a blessing. The geological rock formations (hoodoos) are otherworldly and absolutely beautiful when brushed with snow. We walked (paved paths) to most of the viewpoints along the rim of the canyon.This was our second trip to Bryce (the first was a hiking trip), and we continue to be awed by the beauty of the place."

We have the annual park pass, so the entrance fee for half the park wasn't an issue for us. This also made traveling through the park very fast, compared to other national parks. And guess what? We still loved every bit of it! The views are outstanding and the walking paths are up close to a lot of rock formations. The flat paths around these view points are easy for small children to enjoy. The lodge is a little lackluster compared to other national parks, but they had a really nice gift shop selling local goods. April is still very chilly, more so than other southern Utah parks. Bundle up with layers. Don't pass up this cherished spectacle."

When we drove from Zion through the tunnel our choice was 2 hours to Bryce on the left or 2 hrs to Vegas on the right, making our way to Sedona. We turned right and explored many places, doing plenty of hikes. We decided to cut our stay short in Sedona to swing by the Grand Canyon South Rim and drive to Bryce. Wow is all I have to say!
Bryce Canyon is so unique and different with its spires etc. It blew me away! Even the drive through Red Canyon was just gorgeous! I’d love to bike there! We stopped at all the lookouts and were surprised there were so few people on a Saturday morning! We had no problem parking our rv and it was great! We had to wear jackets cause it was cool and windy but so worth it! There were hiking trails that we’ll definitely hike when we go back there! It was way more beautiful and breathtaking than Grand Canyon in my opinion. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this is definitely a beauty to see!

The hoodoos in the snow are beautiful. ONE DAY is ENOUGH time spent here when snow is on the ground and ALL the trails are closed.
Visit in the summer and fall if you plan to hike among the hoodoos. Best Western is a great place to stay. Breakfast is appreciated. Dinner options are really limited. The food here will not impress you. Where ever you go for dinner.... keep to the simple items on the menu. A well made sandwich and bowl of soup is preferable to a steak damaged beyond recognition."

It is true beauty in nature. But dress appropriately. Only the rim trail is open but do trudge along—it offers awesome views. I say trudge because the trail is thick messy snow in places and sloppy mud in others. In the morning it is all frozen. We parked at sunset point and walked toward inspiration point. You can walk to many (but not all) of the viewpoints.
You can also drive to a number of viewpoints. Do drive to Bryce point. There are a couple of viewpoints along the way. The trails are closed up there too but you can get to a viewpoint.
It is still pretty quiet at the park. I went early Monday morning (7:40) and saw 6 people. Yes, I was too late for sunrise. Get up earlier than I did! By 10am there were more people, but really not many.

If you don't have this as a place to visit on your bucket list, add it.
We learned some things worth noting on your trip. If you are coming in the summer, you can stop here.
1. Bryce can get lots of snow. The views with snow are stunning and worth the trip, but the trails below the rim are closed in winter and often well into Spring. We visited at the end of March and the trails were still going to be closed for at least another week or two.
2. If you visit in the winter or spring, be prepared for both cold and wind. The wind on the bluffs can quickly chill you to the bone. Make sure to wear layers.
3. The hikes you can do are still worth it in the Winter and Spring. The rim hike was a great experience, as every stop along the way gave another and different beautiful view of the hoodoos. The Mossy Cave hike was fun, and the ice formations in the cave were cool."

Stayed for a full 24 hrs and were able to pack in 6 hikes thanks to the connectivity between trails (and shuttle). Visit was at the end of June which aided our hiking in that we hiked all the way until 9 pm without a torch. Campsites were so close to trails and quiet during sleep hours. Visitor Center provides a respite in the late afternoon from the sun, as well as do the little shops. Bring and drink plenty of water and use a refillable bottle as it is easy with so many fill stations at convenient locations around the park. Whether you have 24 hrs or a few days, whether you do one hike or twelve, you will be thankful you saw this wonder.
Tip: Begin your day at 6am and enjoy the cooler temps and smaller crowds. It's worth it to see the colors on the rocks during sunrise and to be getting back for lunch in the shade while the crowds are just staring their day!
Take advantage of the light and do ""night"" hikes! While 7:30pm seems late to start a hike, it is light enough and you can see a different set of colors on the hoodoos. Again, colder temps, no people, and an effective way to get your dinner digestion going."

Not much in Bryce City and hotels are pricey for what you get and not many good restaurant options.

We had our own car so we drove there. We stayed in Tropic and Bryce Canyon was easily accessible from there and there is a portion of the park that is closer to Tropic. We visited the park in mid March so there was some snow and we couldn't visit some of the park. Notwithstanding, what we did see was sufficient and fantastic and gave us a very good taste of the beauty of the park. It was easy to walk the trails even with snow. Some spots were icy but accessible nonetheless. At this time of year, there weren't that many tourists so it was very pleasant. Notwithstanding being a month later might have given us access to more of the park. All in all it we were very pleased and happy to have visited this beautiful park."

However, despite some trail closures we made the best of it and hiked to both sunrise and sunset point as well as inspiration point and we did a very, very cool snow shoe hike put on by the Park Ranger and it was free. This made a day with lots of trail closures sooooo amazing and so worth it. This place is absolutely beautiful and we are looking forward to coming back in warmer months and hiking Navajo trail and some of the others that were closed down in the canyon. The views from the top were more than worth the trip during an unusually snowy winter. Bring your crampons and be sure to check at the Visitor Center for any Park led hikes or activities.

In the end, we all felt this was more visually interesting than the Grand Canyon. There was some limitation on trails we could walk - it was way more cold, windy and snow covered here than it had been down in Zion earlier that week. But it is so unique and worth the drive up. We had been advised to drive to the end of the road in the park and work our way back - good advice. Many of the stops offer similar views and you can choose to start skipping them, but if you start at the front, you might quit before you get to the end and that view was great at the highest point. There weren't really many food places around and what was there wasn't open in December, but that's not why we came. Beautiful drive even if you can't do alot of walking. Just get out at the various pull offs and enjoy the view. We spent way longer here than we thought we would so allow 3-4 hours at least."

Other than the beginning and end of the trail where you’re on switch backs going down or up, the rest of the trail in the canyon is pretty easy.
Multiple places where you can stand at the edge and look down at the sheer majesty of the hoodoos.. without any rock walls or fencing keeping you back. If you have kids, you need to watch them VERY carefully.
The temps were amazingly very moderate compared to the rest of the desert areas we went to visit other national parks, but you still should bring a hat and lots of water and sunscreen.

While not as grand or expansive as the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon shines with more intimate views highlighted by unique hoodoos. The distinct color of the rocks provides a beautiful contrast to the vegetation and blue skies.
The park is very popular and parking lots at popular viewpoints can fill up. There is a shuttle bus you can use instead to avoid that hassle during peak times. The large visitor center is well-staffed and has a large gift shop. However, for dining, you will need to go to the lodge or drive back outside the park. Most of the best views are in the Bryce Amphitheatre area. However, don’t forget to drive south to see the rest of the park.
The hikes into the canyon are also beautiful. Though make sure to bring ample water and sun protection if hiking in the summer. Also keep in mind you are at a high altitude and the uphill climb back from the hikes can be strenuous."

It was beautiful and you had the option to drive and stop at the overlooks, or get out and Hike some trails. I did both and I was not disappointed. The Rangers where excellent at pointing out things to see if you are on a time crunch.
I would go back there any time and plan to see it again."

But you know that, given your efforts to get to this remote and gorgeous piece of the world. Who can say anything that will match the magnificent and abundant beauty of Bryce? You would have to be a poet.
I am reviewing the park just to provide a suggested travel plan.....we are fit and enjoy hiking, but we are not interested in hours of hiking. So for us, we took the following actions. We went to the visitor center inside the park, and got info and checked current conditions. Then we drove to Inspiration although most visitors will be there when the shuttles are running. Having gotten to Inspiration Point then we walked to Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. We took it easy and enjoyed the beautiful overlooks. Very pleasant walking a paved path with stunning hoodoo formations to gawk at--spend a couple of hours and take lots of pictures. Your friends will be wowed by the fantastic pictures.
The next day we went on a driving tour of Scenic Byway 12. Bryce is actually part of the Highway 12 experience. I reviewed this elsewhere in Tripadvisor. It was a unique and thrilling road trip for a day and broke up the hiking a bit.
On the third day in the morning we returned to Sunrise Point and hiked down into the Navajo Trail, the Queens Garden, and Wall Street which are all connected. Again the paths were well maintained and broad, so the big drop-offs weren't so scary. Parents would have to be mindful of their kids. Hiking poles are helpful. Wear heavy duty shoes....no sandals or sneakers!!! We had sandwiches and enjoyed a rest at the bottom of the canyon.
Having a big hike in the morning we enjoyed driving out to the end of the park without stopping to Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point. Dont miss Yovimpa its easy to overlook. Then having enjoyed these vantage points go back on your same road but stop at the turn outs. Lots to see.
Go in October-May and you will have much less company than the the high summer season. Our November experience was fantastic with very few tourists about. The temperature also should be moderate and not the 100 degrees of July for example. Open your mind and soul to the beauty of Bryce and come away invigorated and rested."

We were in the park for 2 different days and really enjoyed it. The park staff were very friendly and helpful, the hikes were well marked, the park was very clean, and the views were awesome. Totally worth it. The peek a boo loop trail combined with the Navajo loop trail are really worth hiking. takes about 3.5 hours all in ( includes lots of stops for photos) It was difficult only because of lots of ups and downs. The second day we did the Queen's/Navajo loop trails. Took about 2 1/2 hours, again with lots of photo stops. Again, it was worthwhile. Both trails are wide enough that even our ""height issues"" members felt safe. The weather was mostly sunny but cool for both days. so a bonus !!"

It is a very well maintained park. (Please note that in all of our park visits in Utah, Arizona and NM, the park rangers were extremely focused on park protection and guest service. They were ALL passionate about their duty and focus and a joy to interact with). Do your research on what the park offers regarding vistas to enjoy and hikes to take. Bryce Canyon must be put on your list. We did not stay as long as we had wanted due to time constraints but hope we can get back to see more. One word of caution; this park as with all the other parks we visited, there is little to no cell service so be prepared. We would suggest strongly carrying a satellite GPS device especially if you are going on hikes. There is NO wifi anywhere at these places other than your hotel (if offered). Even in more populated areas, cell service can be spotty and at a low technical band width."

It was just as fabulous as we recall it (perhaps, even more so) and the sheer beauty, scale and grandeur simply take one's breath away. However, it's not all about the 'classical' viewpoints - no; to get the very best out of Bryce one has to descend into that maze like wonderland of Hoodoos and winding tracks to really make the most of the location. We took on a number of trails during our stay - the Queens Garden Trail and Navajo Trails are 'must do's', but we also did the Peekaboo Loop trail as well and that was well worth the effort (note: do it in the directions suggested - clockwise; it's a little less energy sapping that way!). Take plenty of water - it is a dry and arid place down there - but the efforts are well worth it with some stunning views and locations and a few little hidden delights that take you by surprise - especially round Peekaboo. Sunrise and Sunset Points are, of course, well populated at their respective times but worth the effort irrespective of time of year, whilst a drive deep into the park also affords some alternative viewpoints and changes to the scenery and geology on show - Rainbow and Yovimpa Points are both well worth the drive up into the park to see something a little different and experience the Park to it's fullest. Have a visit and you won't fail to be stirred and impressed in equal measure."

Visiting this park will leave you speechless & breathless- amazing scenes of unbelievable beauty. The park has a visitor center - you can also see videos there, and go with the shuttle (or you can drive your car) to the park main stops & lookout points: Rainbow Point, Sunrise Point & Sunset Point. You will be mesmerized at the “hoodoos” rock formations that create vast “amphitheaters”. Such structures are in amazing white and vibrant red & orange colors.
Do your homework ahead of time to plan your visit, learn about the history, geology etc and the length of hikes so you can maximize your time.
A MUST DO: go the scenic way from Bryce to Zion: this is a fantastic & unique drive, on itself one of the main attractions of the area: the rocks are of the most amazing colors : white Navajo stone, rose, violet, reds, amazing.
Can’t wait to go back. Note: Also suitable for wheelchairs."

With only a half day we could have spent more time here. You might enjoy the resident deer or the Navajo Loop hike as we did. The hike has an approximate change in elevation of about 600 feet so you might have to stop occasionally to catch your breath, but it’s doable in an hour and a half. Like all hiking in Utah, bring sensible footwear, water and a hat. The scenery is stunning so you will be stopping a lot (good for brief rests) to take pictures. At the end of August we didn’t have any trouble with parking.
Buy the annual park pass if your trip includes any other national parks such as Grand Canyon or nearby Zion. Great value at $80/ vehicle (non-transferable)."

The cost to enter Bryce is $35 for each car. Your Sr. pass will pay for itself in just a few visits to National Parks. After entering Bryce, stop at the visitors center and walk through the exhibits and watch the short film. After stopping, drive the entire way to the end of the entrance road and stop at every lookout pull off during your return trip. We stopped at a picnic area on our way to end of the road and had a nice lunch before the majestic viewing began. Rock formations that must be seen by all people especially Americans. Mother nature has created the most fabulous scenery of rock formations maybe in the world. Give yourself 2-4 hrs. for stops and viewing. Words cannot describe what you will see during your visit.

The next morning, we arrived at inspiration point about 30 min prior to sunrise (spectacular!!) and hiked Navajo and Peek-a-Boo Loops.

The shades of burnt orange and the steep canyon walls will take your breath away. There are several hikes within the canyon, along with multiple observation points of varying heights you can drive to within the park. We did a father aggressive hike starting at Sunset Point, then descending the canyon to do portions of the Queens Garden, Navajo, and Peekaboo Loops. Plan your hikes ahead of time as some of these trails are the same trails they do horseback, and you will need to navigate loads of horse manure and urine which could turn you off. Be sure to end your hike in the canyon visiting “Wall Street” and navigating the steep switchbacks up through this part of the canyon.
If you have time and are not camping in the park, come back at night to Sunset Point to star-gaze. It’s simply amazing what you can see in the sky with no light pollution!"

A word of advice: if you are not properly prepared to hike don’t try to trek down to the bottom. The track is too full of loose pebbles & grit and one can very easily slip. Besides the climb up is not easy, I can assure you."

You would be surprised how often people exclude Bryce while planning trips. We did a loop that started out in Las Vegas to Zion to Bryce to Lake Powell (which included Horse shoe bend, Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon and a cruise on the lake through Antelope canyon again) to Grand Canyon and then to Sedona and back to Las Vegas. Out of all the awesome beauty and fun adventures on this trip, we were in awe with how beautiful Bryce is. As with most national parks, it's easy to drive and park at Bryce's many lots... only a short walk from majestic sights. You can be happy doing just this but there is sooooo much more. The loop trails are absolutely unreal. You have safe wide switch backs into the canyon with soaring stone walls and through tunnels cut into stone. At the bottom you have miles of trails weaving through beautiful pines. If you're an advanced hiker and prefer solitude, go further as most people hike only a portion from either side of loop trails or better yet, pick trails that aren't loops. I hate to pick a favorite place of all we visited but this is definitely highest on the list for beauty, rejuvenating the soul and overall satisfaction....we hiked a lot in 24 hours trying to absorb as much as we could and wished we allowed another day!"

There was a visitor centre and they had a map showing the various walks that we could do, as it is a huge canyon. They then have a shuttle that takes you around the various locations in the park.
We got out and looked at the rim trail and admired the view, but then we got back on the shuttle and I think we did the Queen's garden walk, then we joined another trail and came up through the Wall St section.
it was absolutely incredible.
The only issue is that there are no bathrooms on the trail. We also should have taken more water with us, as the walk was quite long and very hot.

Some of the stone formations, such as the spire-shaped rocks, are similar to ones I’ve seen in the stone forests of China. The rock formations are mostly crimson in colour, with layers of different shades, likely depicting events of millions of years ago. This is a great park for hiking and getting close up views of the amazing formations. It is like being on another plant in a far-distant world.

Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. The area was settled by Mormon pioneers and was named for Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. It was designated a National Monument in 1923 and a National Park in 1928. Remote, it attracts fewer visitors than Zion National Park and Grand Canyon National Park each year. But there are aspects about Bryce that are unique to one and all. For example, a series of amphitheaters extends more than 20 miles north to south within the park. The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is 12 miles long, three miles wide and 800 feet deep. Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at 9,105 feet, is at the end of the 18-mile scenic drive. From there, Aquarium Plateau, Bryce Amphitheater, the Henry Mountains, the Vermillion Cliffs and the White Cliffs can been seen. Archaeological surveys show people have been in the area for at least 10,000 years. But it was not until the late 18th and early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area. Mormons visited the area in the 1850s. The first major scientific expedition was led by John Wesley Powell in 1872. The park has 13 scenic viewpoints over the amphitheaters, eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day, two overnight hiking trails, more than 10 miles of marked but ungroomed skiing trails, two campgrounds and the 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge. The air is so clean that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles away in Arizona. On extremely clear days, the Black Mesa of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico can been seen 160 miles away."

Watching the sun hit the canyon and subtly change the colors was breathtaking.

Note: If you go in the Fall, pack for both warm and cold weather. Planned on shorts and a sunhat, but ended up in long pants, a fleece jacket, wool cap and gloves.

The trees were covered with snow. We went into the visitor center and bought a Walkingstick. I think we started at either Inspiration zpPoint or Bryce Point. The walk was a little treacherous but there were hand rails. The views were incredible! We went to every viewpoint on the park. We were not disappointed with anyone of them. In the afternoon once it warmed up quite a bit we went back to Brycepoint and walked and the upper rim Trail. Some parts were a little muddy but it seems like a safe walk. Late in the afternoon, we hiked the mossy cave trail to the waterfall. That was gorgeous! I even liked it better than the waterfall in Zion. We were so thankful that we were there on the day we have been there because people have been there a couple days earlier and there was a snowstorm and they couldn’t see anything. I would watch the weather averages to decide when would be a good time to visit. I am from Chicago 30° there felt warmer then 50° here. The only time it felt windy and I needed a hood was on that upper rim Trail. We went to sunset view to take pics of the sunset but found out that the pics would have been better at 5 then at 6."

Visibility was really miserable. We decided to drive down to the far end of the road, hoping that by the time we got there, the fog would have burned off. We were surprised to find ourselves driving through a snowstorm - it was deep enough that the plows were out.
Anyway, the sun broke through, and we had a wonderful day in the park. We did the Queen’s Garden trail, and returned on the Two Bridges side of the Navaho Loop. I’d consider this a must-do for anyone who is able. It’s an amazing, enchanting walk. The trail was crowded, but most people seemed to be having a good time.
Bryce Canyon National Park is beautiful, and unlike any other place I’ve ever seen. Highly recommended.
I was surprised by the number of tour groups, but there were relatively few private cars, and although there is a shuttle bus, it was perfectly possible to take your own car instead (unlike in Zion, and the far reaches of Grand Canyon NP.)"

Sunset Campground was muddier, with more puddles, more potholes. The dump stations were closed, as was the dump in front of Ruby’s in town. There are no hookups in the park. No reservations are taken, first come/first served. We arrived around 11 and had several spots to choose from. By evening all the spots were full. There are restrooms, dishwashing sinks, water pumps, and a shower at the entrance which we didn’t use.
PARKING: We took the camper off the truck and drove to Sunrise/Sunset which is within the campground. Parking was available (it was a Tuesday) but we never did make it to the visitor center. The parking lot was full every time we drove by. The next morning we drove to the far end of the park to Rainbow Point. At 8 am we were the only ones there. The roads were snowy so I’m sure this kept people away. By 10 am the lots were filling up on the trip back towards the entrance.
FOOD: The food in the park was either grocery store choices or the restaurant in the lodge which was pricy.
We thought we’d have lots of dinner choices in town but a lot of the restaurants had 2-3 stars, not a good sign, or they were pretty expensive, or had very long waits. We settled on the Cowboy Ranch House. Not fancy but decent. There was also a Subway, the only fast food place in Bryce.
WHAT WE DID AND SAW: We hiked the Navajo Loop and visited every major viewpoint. Upper Inspiration Point was the best view by far. Early mornings and late afternoon will give you the best photo opportunities when you get some shadow off the hoodoos. The weather can change fast! We didn’t even wear coats on Tuesday. Wednesday morning we woke up to snow on the ground. The Rim Trail has a lot to see."

The views were absolutely spectacular.
I have learnt always bring clothes for cold weather. It snowed overnight and it was a chilly morning with ice patches.
We took a small 3 hour tour with Bryce Canyon Scenic Tours . Our guide was Nabor and he was very good.
It is easy to drive around the park too.
About 40 minute drive plus stops at the lookouts.
Sunrise, sunset and Inspiration Point were our favorites.
You can also take the shuttle bus through the park to the main lookouts.
Plus you can do about a one hour loop walk. This can be hard as the air is thin at this high altitude.
A not to be missed experience."

We have left the auto on a parking in front of the park (it is much better to go there with a shuttle bus). Than we went with this bus till the last point (Bryce point) and than have gone on foot back. We have visited Inspiration point, Sunrise & sunset points and have made a Navajo loop trail (about 40-50 Minutes).
The nex day we went to see the sunrise there and it was a thrilling view (was just about 40 Grad - so very very cold) and a lot of people, so you need to come earlier when you want to park there.

We made a day trip from La Verkin and were enchanted, even though the more distant parts of the park were temporarily closed by rangers because of a managed forest fire following a lightning strike a few days earlier.
We gradually worked into the highlights of Sunset and Sunrise Points from more distant overlooks, which were all in themselves beautiful, until we reached the central vantage points, which were simply stunning in the colours and varieties of shapes seen. As Bryce himself said when first viewing the myriad of eroded pinnacles: 'It's a helluva place to lose a cow'!
One could easily spend hours just marvelling at the works of nature revealed here. Those fit enough to hike down to the floor of the amphitheatre would get a different perspective, but even just viewing from above is awe-inspiring. The nature of the rock formations together with the colours revealed by the erosion over millions of years is breath-taking. One of the highlights of our trip."

The color and the beauty of the landscape is beyond compare. Years of weathering in the canyon has produced hoodoos. This is what they call the carvings in the canyon that can look like actual people and animals. You can look at one and see several different things at one time The nice thing is once you enter the park you can drive around and see different views of the canyon. During the month of July, temperatures are very hot and you can always expect a pop-up thunderstorm in the afternoon, so plan on your trip starting in the morning and ending mid afternoon.

Views are absolutely spectacular. We took a picnic with us. There is an area to buy food there but it's expensive.
My favorite area was the Natural Bridge. We also loved Inspiration Point. There is a big hill there to walk up and if you're somewhat fit try and do it.

Each park is amazing on its own merit. Arches was our favorite based on shear beauty. Bryce Canyon however, was our favorite based on uniqueness and hiking. The hoodoos are like nothing I have ever seen. My wife suggested Bryce Canyon is like walking in an aquarium without the water. The formations reassemble delicate coral on a reef more than rock outcroppings. The trail difficulty ratings at Bryce seem a little underrated to us. We are fairly healthy 60+ year olds, but the moderate trails included significant elevation changes unlike the other parks. We experienced continuous climbs over 500 feet. Definitely doable, but check with the ranger if unsure. Gotta see it!!"

The red rock formations with vertical spires are simply awesome. The park road is about 18 miles long and is not a through road, so you have to drive to the end (if you wish) and then turn around and return on the same road. That does give you the opportunity to stop at some of the overlooks you may have missed. The park road raises to an elevation of about 9115 ft and can get quite cool as the sun sets, even on a warm day at the park entrance.
You can easily spend 3 to 4 hours in the park just to view most of the scenic overlooks. However, if you are limited in time, I recommend must stops at Sunset Point Overlook and Natural Bridge Overlook (a different rock formation from the rest of the park). Wear layers of clothing because the weather can change quite rapidly. We visited on a warm, sunny day in Early September and could see rain clouds in the very far distance. However, within one hour, the clouds rolled in with thunder and lightning, and disappeared again within an hour.
i believe this is one of the most beautiful and unusual national parks and highly recommend a visit when in southwestern Utah."

The HooDoos are awe inspiring and otherworldly. That being said, we did a very long hike ( around 15 miles) around and up and down the canyon and a couple of words of advice:
First - it can be exerting. Just remember - what goes down must come up. This can be helped with a planned out use of the shuttle buses. We, unfortunately, got there very early (before sunrise) and parked ar Fairyland Point parking lot - the shuttle DOES NOT go there - so if you do park there know you need to be able to hike back to it.
Water is scarce - There was water and a store at Sunset point, but otherwise I did not find any ( there may be some - but we did not find any) - it was not especially hot and we still went through all of our camelback bladders - so be prepared with extra supplies if you plan on doing the long hikes
Finally - with all the beauty - it is not a varied hike - more or less the same sort of views throughout. So if you want variety you may not want to do a whole day as well did and split your hike up with another location"

we used the shuttle bus and that worked perfectly, very fast and every 10 minutes or so. the bus goes around so you should take care to do the things in that direction as otherwise you need to make more or less the full round to go back but there are some tricks how to avoid that as some of the stations going and back are just across the street. bryce point which is the start is amazing probably the highlight point, take your time there, then moved to inspiration point which has a lower and upper and the upper is a short but quite steep hike up.
we hiked from there to sunset point which is a flat and easy track on the rim. on the sunset point depending on your condition do the navoyo loop which is a 1,3 miles hike and you go into and really see the how high and magnificent it is.
we are not hikers and we did in about one hour some areas are really steep so take care you will work out a good sweat and your feet will hurt a bit, but the views are great.
there are many other trails and from sunset point you can hike to sunrise point as well but that is longer."

The drive is spectacular with animals all over during the early morning hours.
I got there just before sunrise to beat the crowds. You'll find a lot of scenic hiking areas, tours, and shuttle buses during the business hours. Massive amounts of RV camp areas, and tent camp areas in the park. A lot of deer all over the place. Read up on the BLM and National Park information to know the rules and fees for camping and hiking. It's a great place to spend an hour or 2 for photos. Or to camp for a few days and take it all in."

Ok now from Inspiration Point head down to Sunset Point.
Sunset Point is a great place to have lunch, fill up your water bottles and use the bathroom. Ok now you will descend down to Navajo Trail towards the Two Bridges. From here you will head toward the Queens Garden Trail and Sunrise Point. In my opinion this is the best way to do it. You will be walking uphill from Queens Garden to Sunrise Point but it’s way better to do this sequence then the opposite like I did. However is reading this you’ll thank me lol. Enjoy"

Took some pictures. My wife and I revisited this year, 2018. It all looks the same, (Geological changes are slow.) But, it is just as beautiful as it was the first time.
Utah is known for its parks and monuments, and although each one is a geologic marvel, each one is also unique itself. Bryce is spectacular for its orange hoodoos. And they are easy to see. There are pull outs and parking lots to view them from, all along the main drive. We opted to just drive to each one and look, and then leave, since my wife cannot hike. If you hike, remember that if you go down, you have to come back up, and it is a whole lot easier going down. It can be misleading as you descend. (Been there, done that.) Remember to bring lots of water if you do any hiking. I noticed that they also have a pleasant looking paved bike path.
At the entrance to the park is a small village where just about anything you might need is available.
Crowds at the time we went, early September, weren't overwhelming. Only at the furthest viewing spot, Rainbow Point, did parking become congested. Otherwise, it was easy to find parking at each viewing location, and traffic on the road was not a problem. It appeared that a shuttle was also available, but I am not sure how far it goes, or how often."

Outside the center are signs encouraging visitors to park across the street and take the shuttle to your destination v driving your car. After a bit of ""debate"" with my husband, he caved and took the shuttle but not without some grumbling. Good thing his wife was right again... me. He thought we could just drive to the trail head, park, and be on our way. Wrong. While riding the shuttle and stopping at each checkpoint, that's when we discovered there are very few parking spots; hence good luck on trying to find a spot without having to constantly circle back, etc. So we got off at our trailhead, hiked to another trailhead and caught the shuttle to go back to the visitor's center. This was especially nice insofar as 1) We listened to our driver, George, who gave some interesting factoids we would not have otherwise heard (he also was VERY entertaining); and 2) we got caught in a rain storm and were drenched. So boarding the bus and having someone drive us back was a relief.
If you get a good driver, a shuttle ride can be a great experience. Even if the driver is not as entertaining as George, you at least can reach your destination without having to try and find a parking spot. Again, kudos to the National Park Service for creating a user-friendly destination."

The hike to see them is short, and you can look down into the amphitheater full of them. As the sun changes position, so do the colors of these spires. We also stopped at the Fairyland Point and walked to look at the hoodoos. This gives visitors another great view of them. There is also a stop, which does not require hiking, to view the Natural Bridge. There are certainly other hikes, which are outlined in the material provided at the entrance, and the people at the visitor center are always helpful in planning a day in the park. This park can get pretty crowded, so parking in some areas can be challenging, but it is certainly worth a visit."

The other shuttles go every 10 minutes and you can jump on and off at different sites. I think this is the best Park I’ve Visited."

Unlike Capitol Reef where one feels part of ""nature"", this park has many many tourists. Some mostly interested in taking selfies. Others rushing through. Some thinking driving 15 mph in a 45 mph zone is perfectly fine So the 4 star rating is because of the tourists.
Bryce scenery without the tourists is 5 star. Its amazing how many unique desert landscapes there are in this part of Utah (Capital Reef, Escalante Staircase, and of course Bryce)"

When you take a picture take it over your head, so you just see your face against the hoodoos - it is really cool! From there we did the rim trail down to sunset point. You can't take your eyes off the hoodoos, as you descend down to sunset. At sunset you have the option to get up close and personal w/ the hoodoos and take the Navajo trail. We wish we had more time, as we would have liked to descend to the base of the canyon, but ran out of time. It is very worth it!!!!"

The hoodoos make this place truly fascinating. Weathering and erosion shape these rocks. As snow melts, water seeps into fractures. As it refreezes, it expands and cracks around it. The entire Bryce Canyon has been formed by this frost wedging process.
High elevation, clean dry air, and lack of light pollution make Bryce Canyon one of the darkest places at earth and consequently one of the best places for star gazing."

The trail runs above Bryce Canyon and connects all the scenic overlooks from Fairyland Point to Bryce Point. … Please note that it gets very steep at the end (probably the last half mile), which you do not need to do. Take your time to enjoy; take a day pack with water and sandwiches or snacks. There are plenty of scenic places to sit with your family and loved ones - and just unclutter your mind with the surrounding beauty! Enjoy

A few things about the park:
- go to the visitor center first. Theres an info desk with very helpful people to help plan what trails you wish to hike. We only did the rim trail and that was perfect!
- wear hiking shoes and take water. The rim has areas of ups and downs but is mostly level.
- you can not park extended time at the visitor center. Across the street there is a free parking lot. Park there. Head towards the campgrounds and you will see a clearing beyond the trees. That is the rim of the canyon! Start walking."

However, there is no real town to speak of and not much in terms of accommodations. Zion has a cute town but Bryce doesn't - there is some touristy stuff by Ruby's but that is it really. If you don't hike there is not much here other than biking. You need to enter the Canyon to appreciate the beauty from top to bottom."

We parked at the visitor centre and took the free shuttle as we had heard that parking at the different stops in the park can be difficult in the summer with many visitors.
This worked really well as we went to Bryce Point on the shuttle, and then walked up to inspiration point and then to Sunset Point, with beautiful views of the canyon. We then went down on the Navajo loop and then onto the Queens garden trail up to the Sunrise point, the scenery is unbelievable!
We were staying in Springdale and did the trip to Bryce Canyon in one day, about 4 hours drive in total, with an early start in the morning, with some beautiful views on the way. Our tip would be to get there relatively early, use the shuttle, do some of the hikes to get a good view from the canyon, bring a picnic, take a lot of water, and do not forget hat, suncream and your camera!"

We really only spent about 24 hours here, got in later in the day the first day and left after lunch the second day. All in all, that was enough time to see the highlights. Went to the star-gazing with the telescopes the rangers set up at the visitor's center on certain evenings. That was pretty cool, but lots of people and the wait was pretty long to get through the lines to see the star formations. The second day we walked the rim trail from Bryce Point to Sunset Point, great hike to see the best parts of the Canyon. At Sunset Point, we hiked into the canyon on the Navajo Loop trail. That was very cool, but the hike back up is no joke, make sure to bring plenty of water. There is another shuttle that will take you all the way to the end of the park, but we felt like we saw the highlights in the time we had. Highly recommend if you are in the area."

The views are breathtaking and the hikes are a lot of fun. However I am writing this review to point out the National Park Service shuttle buses and what a great choice it was to utilize this free service. I am not talking about the shuttles that come every 10 minutes, I mean the 3 hour guided tour bus that leaves from Ruby's at 9am and 1:30 pm. This is the best way to see and learn about Bryce before you go in and wander around on your own. We had a wonderful local driver named April who was fabulous. She told us many great tips to use to enjoy our stay.
You need to reserve the tour! It's free, visit the Bryce/NPS website for info to reserve your seats no more than 7 days prior to arriving.
Kudos to Bryce and the NPS for providing this great service. Enjoy!"

Hiking into the canyon fun and memorable.
However, we were shocked by the poor management: e.g. illegible interpretive signage that should have been replaced LONG AGO. Literally could not read many signs.
Rotting wooden barriers and benches that should be replaced. How can one of the most frequently visited parks in the system be allowed to fall into such bad condition!? Where’s all the entry fee money going? We came from the Grand Teton National Park and saw an enormous difference in quality of management."

The views are just breathtaking. Seriously, I feel like time spent there restores my soul. There are a wide variety of trails for hiking, some relatively easy and others more strenuous. Always be sure to check the weather, afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer and lightning strikes are prevalent (just check out the blackened trees along the Rim Trail.)
If your time is limited, hike portions of the Rim Trail, including Inspiration Point. There is a free shuttle system you can access along the trail if you tire of walking. The Rim Trail is fairly easy, though portions of it are hilly and do NOT have railing, so be careful of venturing too close to the canyon edge. Hikes into the canyon are wonderful, but make sure there's no rain in the forecast. I once had to navigate one of the trails in a downpour and it NOT something I care to repeat.
There are several spots along the Rim Trail where rangers offer talks about the canyon. These are well worth your time."

So that shouldn't be an excuse when I admit that it's been ten years since the last time I visited! I was only there for a quick overnight visit this time...because it was peak season for the Perseid meteor shower.
We arrived mid afternoon, went to the bypassed the visitors center and went to the rim. We did a short hike from Sunset to Sunrise lookout points (I believe that's what they're called). I definitely suggest going sunset to sunrise instead of vise versa. Either way, you'll have about 350 ft of elevation change down and then back up again in a roughly 2.5 mile loop!
No matter the season, bring more water than you think you'll need, possibly a light snack, hiking poles if you have them...oh, and your camera! Take your time, but pay attention to the clock. I'd say we went at the perfect time to beat most of the heat (roughly 5:30 pm in mid-August).
There are other places in the park to visit if you want...more strenuous hikes, and light hikes around the rim. You can get up early or stay up later for sunrise/sunset photo opportunities. The rangers are all knowledgeable and friendly.
Definitely worth a multiple day stay if you can swing it. Oh...and some of the DARKEST skies in the USA! So stay up late and look at the stars if you can!"

There was no shuttle yet so we were able to bring our car inside and drove and see the different vista points. It was too cold though because the winter was just ending. And it was raining a little bit that made the temperature colder so we were in and out of the car. The view was stunning and only few people so you can really enjoy the place minus the weather.
But if you have been in Grand Canyon, Bryce is not far from what you have had experienced."

We planned our visit with a stay in the Lodge which allowed us to view the canyon past sunset and we were right there for sunrise. It was very warm making the trails hot but tolerable. The park was clean in all the areas we visited. There was ample parking assisted in part by the shuttle that operated from outside the park and then throughout the visitor areas. I would recommend a visit in spring or late summer/fall if you stay at the lodge as there is no air conditioning and it can be very warm."

It's July, the air is fresh because it's morning but you know soon it will be very hot. Suddenly the red hills appear after a corner and you think it cannot be better than this but you're wrong. As soon as you leave the car and reach the Canyon, e.g. at Sunset point, you've a mind blowing experience.
The colors and shapes of the rocks are unbeliavable. No picture gives justice and you can stop looking around noticing detail after detail.
Even the shortest trail worth taking some heat and it's a fun park of the kids as well. Smell the scent of the trees, observe the birds that live chasing bugs or soaring over your head, be curios like the squirrels that appear and disapper like magicians"

But let's say that you can't spend more than a couple of hours at Bryce, since you have to drive like a crazy person to the airport to return your rental car. What then?
1. Start early so there's a reasonable chance you can park inside the park. You don't have to drive from place to place inside the park, but it really speeds things up to avoid taking the shuttle in from the ""Ruby's Area"". We probably wasted 20 minutes going in a circle after parking in the main outside parking lot.
2. Drive into the park at least as far as Sunset Point/Parking area. See if you can park there; if so, you can see a heck of a lot of the park and it's only taken you a few minutes to get there.
3. If you're up for it (and remember, the elevation is 8,000 feet and it's frequently blistering hot), take the Navajo Trail down into the canyon. You don't have to go too far, although you should if you have the time and lots of water, since you get dramatically different perspectives by just descending a few hundred feet.
4. Consider walking along the rim to the next parking area, then take the shuttle back to wherever you started. The rim is relatively flat, and the changing perspectives are, well, changing.
5. Not all places on the shuttle route connect easily, so take a few minutes to understand this. You may end up going further than you have time for, and I found it a little confusing until I spent a few minutes with the diagram.
If you arrive at 8:30, you can have a brief but incredible encounter with the park and still leave by 10:30 or 11:00. I know that's how Americans tend to ""do"" Europe and other exotic places (Rome in Three Hours!), but it's still worth it. Best $35 you'll ever spend (or $20 if you're over 62)."

Spectacular views. Drones are prohibited, and there is not much else to do if your goal is not focused on enjoying nature from a very comfortable situation.

Lots of heat so take lots of water on your walk. We decided to do the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail. It is also recommended on the National Park map to do it in a clockwise direction. Either way you are going to get in some fantastic views and plenty of time to do it and places to stop and rest. Doing it this way the climb out felt shorter with the steep switchbacks right at the end. It wasn't scary and I certainly didn't feel unsafe. It's an amazing park to see from start to end but we were limited to the main amphitheatre for this visit. It is also a dark sky area and we stayed back to enjoy the absolutely amazing view of the Milky Way rising above from the rim of the trails. If you are lucky enough to be their on the right night, rangers hold astronomy nights. You see so much more out here."

I will say this, if you can only visit one I'd pick Zion . Having said that, what else can I say about this place others aren't all saying? The views are awesome. The fee to enter is $35 (I bought the annual pass for $80 and it's paid off with all my visits.) There is a shuttle service that will take you to the different overlooks if you don't feel like driving your car. I hiked down into the amphitheater starting at the Queens Garden and then climbed back up the Navajo Trail. Most people say to go the opposite way and it's mainly because of the switchbacks that, in my case ended, this hike. They can be a little rough. But I'll say this I have a fear of heights and it kicked in a little when I first attempted to start with Navajo. So I decided to try starting with Queens Garden instead cause it seemed like a less steep entry point. That's what I did it, and it was. If you also have fear of heights start with Queens but definitely push yourself to continue. Trust me, you'll be glad you did."

It is by far my most favorite ahead of Zion and Grand Canyon. The unique rock formations are so picturesque.
We arrived at 11:25am at the Visitor’s Center entrance on a July Friday after a 2.5 hr drive from St. George. Entry cost is $35 per vehicle but we used a National park pass. Inside parking was still available at the Center and across the street. We were at the park for 3.5 hours. Shuttle pickup at the Center was standing room only. (Many visitors took advantage of the huge parking lot outside the park. Don’t know how park fees are handled.) Shuttles came at 10 minute intervals. We got off at Shuttle Stop #6, Sunset Point for the most popular hike, Navajo Loop. Even though the hike is considered easy, it is not for someone with fear of heights. The trail is about 8 feet wide. One should walk slowly back up due to the high altitude. Many people were grasping for air including one in our group. (We did not circle the loop this time.) Although Bryce is about 15 degrees cooler than St. George, the temperature was still in the mid 80s. If you can briefly hike though, the stunning view looking up is worth your effort.
After 1.5 hours at Sunset Point, we took the shuttle out of the park and back in before reaching Bryce Point, Shuttle Stop #3 in 50 minutes. (Faster if we had exited shuttle and walked across to catch opposite shuttle at the Visitor’s Center prior to shuttle leaving park.) At Bryce Point, we had spectacular views from lookout point."

This summer while travelling through Utah we visited 4 of the 5 National parks in that state, spending several days at each park (except, Zion). Bryce Canyon was my favourite park. The amphitheatres filled with hoodoos were absolutely spectacular! This is heaven for anyone interested in photography. While most of my time was spent on the rim at the various lookouts, one morning, just after sunrise, we hiked to the base of Bryce amphitheatre (Navajo loop trail) for a different perspective of the hoodoos – highly recommended. If you only have time to visit one Ntl park in Utah, my recommendation is Bryce Canyon."

Shuttle buses are also available if you prefer. We are here for 2 days. Today we saw a lot. Breathtaking shapes formed over 1000's of years. Cant imagine what we'll see on an early start tomorrow. What you will see beggars belief. The wonder of nature.
We went to the visitor centre and watched a short overview film about life in the Canyon. It looked even more splendid snow covered in winter but the temperature drops to unbelievable lows.

I want to encourage people who are considering which parks to visit to include Bryce. It is well worth the extra effort and time. It was easy and comfortable to travel from lookout to lookout in the park in our own car. We could go at a pace that suited us and we never had a problem getting a parking space.

This review about TIPS; limited parking, crowds","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g143015-d1925256-r600259862-Bryce_Canyon_National_Park-Bryce_Canyon_National_Park_Utah.html","Jul 2018 • Couples","LOVED, LOVED, LOVED! Amazing! Instead of giving the same accolades as everyone else... I'll try to give some tips.
TIP #1: If you want to park your car [limited parking] at Sunset Point - do so before 7-8 am. Otherwise, save yourself time and aggravation by using the shuttle system.
PARKING: We got last parking spot at 7 am at Sunset point. When we finished our hike around noon, people in cars were wearily trying to find parking. Park staff keeps folks moving along. They don't let you sit and wait for cars to leave. It blocks the flow of traffic for shuttles. And because there are hiking trailheads [very popular trails] from this spot, parking does NOT open up frequently. For reference, we were parked there for 4-5 hours for our hike. FYI: Most of the people there before 7 am looked to be hikers.
Other parking/traffic: Bryce Point [short, must see, walk to overlook] parking seems to turn over fairly quickly. All the overlooks on the scenic drive, past Bryce Point, also seem to turn over fairly quickly. Natural Bridge is the most worthy feature on the scenic drive. Fairyland overlook, near the park entrance, seems to be ignored and is worth seeing. Very few people. Nice from that aspect alone. Amazing views. Saw deer on the way.
TIP #2: If hiking Queens Garden Trail, take a minute to walk out on the horse trail that leads to Peek-a-boo Trail. Only need to go maybe 100 yards to see the most spectacular 360 view. You feel you are in the middle of the Canyon about 2/3rds of the way up. Easy walk. Away from crowds.
TIP #3: Wear hiking shoes/boots with lugs. Lots of loose small rock, sand and dry soil on trails. Very easy to slip or slide. Especially in the Wall Street section where crowds are distracted and not paying attention to their surroundings or footing. You might be steady and balanced, but someone else in sandals or running shoes next to you, playing with a cell phone or camera often seem to lose their footing and bump into you.
TIP #4: Camelbak.
HIKING: We planned a hike on the Navajo Trail which starts at Sunset Point. It goes thru the very popular and crowded Wall Street section. Worth it! We then used Queens Garden Trail to gain access back up the rim to Sunrise Point. Then walked the rim between Sunrise and Sunset. We did counter-clockwise as easier coming back out of the canyon. Again, the short walk out onto the Horse Trail was worth it!
Enjoy!"

The first one was when we decided to wake up at 5.20 am, to watch the sunrise from 'sunrise point' in Bryce Canyon NP. We would definitely recommend this, as this is an unforgettable experience. The 'waking up'-part is difficult, but being there as you see the sunlight slowly reaching the rock formations of the NP absolutely makes up for the early awakening. Keep in mind that this is early in the morning, so the temperatures are only 'moderate'. Also, the spot is well-known among hikers, so make sure to be there on time if you want a nice photo/view.
Our second experience with Bryce NP is the hike from Sunset point to Sunrise point. The nature that we saw there was simply mesmerizing. The walks between the rocky walls, the views, the rock formations and their interplay with the sun light, the path taking sharp turns deeper into the park (known as 'wallstreet')...
All the natural beauty found in this park cannot be described using words or photos. Therefore I would certainly recommend every hiker that is considering to visit Bryce Canyon NP to do it. The park has a lot to offer, from amazing sunrises and sunsets to (sometimes challenging) hikes. The hike that we did was not particularly hard, but the climbing part at the end (the climb towards sunrise point) was a bit challenging considering the burning sun and the lack of wind.
An absolute must visit for every nature -, and National Park enthusiast!"

You can enjoy the park from the several viewpoints above. But to really experience the park’s magic, you have to go into the canyon. You can walk. It is a steep descent on unguarded narrow switch backs. I think the best way to experience the canyon is by mule or horse rides. I took a half day ride and it is unforgettable. I took lots of photos while my steed did all the work. Another must do at Bryce is to get up early and see the sunrise in the canyon. Again, go into the canyon. You can walk. You don’t have to go too far. Watch the hoodoos as the morning light hits them. The white tips are translucent. It is a view you will never forget."

Literally. We had mild altitude sickness for the first 6-8 hours - breathlessness, dizziness, difficulty speaking and remembering. After lots of water and a good nights sleep, we felt better but it returned when we visited Rainbow Point. Luckily, we were able to get in a little hiking and our symptoms never got severe. We tackled Mossy Cave trail with no problems and Queens Garden trail with just mild difficulty. We are fairly experience hikers, but the elevation at Bryce Canyon kicked our butts.

So much to see, so much to do. I suggest staying in the area for at least 3 nights, 4 days. We stayed at the Best Western, which is only a few minutes from the park, and they have free Park bus service that picks you up and brings you back. About the park, I could spend days writing about it.
We live in Henderson NV, which is only a few hours drive from our home. When you get into the park, they also have free bus tours, that take you all over. They run approx 15 minutes apart, so you can stay at one location for as long as you like. There is a great visitors center that has a food area as well. There are also great hiking trails as well as places you can just sit and enjoy the views. Note, it can get very hot in the summer, so check the weather before you go. I highly recommend this park. If your into photography, get ready to take hundreds of photos."

Like Zion, they recommend parking in town and taking the shuttle to the park. We parked at the Shuttle Station stop, purchased our park admission and rode in. The shuttles runs very frequently and it was a very short wait. The first stop is the visitor center. We stopped to get trail advice, very good idea. Since we only had a day we did the combined Navajo Loop/Queen’s Garden trail. To make it easy on yourself, start at Navajo Loop, shortly after you start the trail, you have a left or right option. Go right, it is steep with a lot of switchbacks, but the way out is easier at the end. The trail is well marked and you end at Sunset Point. Take the path on the right for a short walk to Shuttle Stop 8. This trail allows you to see many “sides” of the canyon - hop-doos, rocks that almost look like sand, a slot canyon and huge pines. It was a gorgeous 3 mile adventure."

Bryce Canyon is nothing short of spectacular. We were awestruck with the beauty and grandeur. Screensavers do nothing for the reality of color, depth and size of the canyon.
We pulled in the second parking lot and just started walking toward the rim. I remember telling my wife, “ this place is supposed to be unbelievable” Once at the edge, we clearly made the vote. This is our new fave. Walked the rim to the lookout on the other side. Easy walk and worth it.
Bring water! As newbies we did not

We came here from being in Zion the previous day and it is soon apparent that the sheer volume of people spoils Zion.

We avoided the shuttle which had a limited range, and drove right through the park and back. We could see a Thunderstorm approaching and rain it surely did, but thankfully on our way back.
Needless to say the views are extraordinary and there are so many spots to stop and try to conceive of the scale of it all. Breathtaking and if you look the other way there is wildlife too.
Quick plug for the general store near Bryce Lodge where we bought, and then ate outside, a sandwich lunch.

I have seen many pictures of Bryce over the years and I had something different (not completely, of course) in my mind. But when I saw this place in person, it was that much more amazing to me how close these hoodoos (rock formation) are to you.
You can make this a short trip and take a very short distance (maybe 100 yards) from the parking lot to the rim and have an overview of the beauty, or make a full day out of it exploring the bottom.
I agree with other reviewers that the hike down in is steep and you should be prepared to hike back the same steepness (I included a picture of the elevation loss/gain). I hiked this after running a half marathon (13.1 miles). Trekking poles may help with the elevation loss and gain, but not required. Hiking shoes are recommended, but not required. There are signs suggesting that as well. I saw people hiking in their Chacos. I saw families hiking with young children. The path is wide and well groomed.
We parked near Sunrise Point and did the Queens/Navajo Loop to Sunset Point (as recommended and rated most popular by the Bryce Canyon Map and Guide. Yes, there were a lot of people, but going there expecting that didn't seem to be that bad. We had to wait a few times for people to take their pictures along the path and for us to get a few shots in, but not terrible.
If you are a trail runner, I thought it would be a little too steep (for my taste) both down and up. We did run some of it, but the motivation was primarily due to a thunderstorm that was rolling in (we got out just before it started to pour rain)."

Man, was I wrong! Bryce Canyon is amazing and unique! The best view is the one by the lodge. However, to truly see the NP's beauty, you must go into the amphitheater. I took the Queens/Navajo loop trail twice. At the bottom of the canyon you are in a forest. The unique colors of the Canyon and trees make it incredibly beautiful. One bit of advice - start the trail at the Queens trailhead and walk up Wall Street. Too perfect!! We stayed two nights in Bryce. We got there in the afternoon and took a hike that evening. The next day, we took an early morning hike. Went back to the hotel to swim and that evening went back and visited all the viewpoints and took the hike at the furthest viewpoint(Bristlestone or something like that). One night, we went into the park to look at stars - oh man!!! Too many."

It's at a higher elevation and therefore not as hot as Zion, which was refreshing. I felt like I really saw the whole park. I started by skipping past the crowds at the visitor's center and driving all the way to the end of the park, which is about 17 miles. The road dead-ends at a parking lot where you can see Rainbow and Yovimpa Points and do the Bristlecone Loop 1 mile hike. Once you turn around and head back, all of the viewpoints are on the ride side of the road and easy to pull in to. I stopped at all of the ones that looked interesting (most of them), such as Natural Bridge, and did a few short hikes. Bryce may not be as crowded overall as Zion, but the viewpoints nearer to the visitor's center (Sunset and Inspiration Points) are really crowded. I wanted to get down into the hoodoos, partly for the experience and partly to get away from the hordes, so I did the Peekabo Loop Trail, which was about 5 miles. It was scenic and completely doable for anyone with a modicum of fitness. Any hike you do into the canyon requires you to walk all the way down first, so as long as you're mentally prepared to come all the way back up, you should be fine. I had a little time the next morning, so I also did part of the Fairyland Loop Trail. I found that incredibly enjoyable, and it was much less crowded than the other areas."

It was much less crowded than Zion and about 15 degrees cooler. The hoodoos were different from what we saw at other parks and were simply incredible.
Our family of five (kids aged 15, 12 and 6) did the Navajo Loop hike, which I highly recommend! You get a nice overlook and then hike into the hoodoos. There’s a really neat section called “Wall Street” that goes through a slot canyon. There’s not much shade and quite a strenuous uphill climb on your exit, so bring water and definitely wear sturdy, non-slip shoes. It was fine for our 6-year old.
We also drove the rest of the scenic loop and had a picnic at the end of it. While there are lots of picnic tables there, they are not in a very interesting area. In hindsight, Sunset or Sunrise Point might have been better for that.
Don’t miss the film in the Visitor’s Center that plays on the hour and half-hour! Also, if you visit during the summer monsoon months, you should go early...they have to close the canyon area if there’s lightening in the area, which seems to happen a lot in the afternoon.
Don’t miss this park! You could experience it in a couple hours if you’re short on time."

It always has much to offer, and great views in all seasons. I personally find it looks best in mid April when there is snow on the Hoodoos and the sky has a lot more color to it. June is different, but also enjoyable, although it is much more crowded!
This time we did both, drive to all the viewing pull off points, and ride the Shuttle Buses. They are great! But if you want to shoot sunrise or sunset pictures, you have to drive your own vehicle because the buses only run from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.
If you want to hike, you should think twice about whether you are capable of doing the 1/2 mile trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. I see it is sometimes listed as paved and ""easy"". It is not paved, and it can be dangerous since it has no guard rails along the cliff side!
The Visitor Center is small. Bryce Lodge is a historic old building, and there is a gift shop with a decent gift shop and restaurant there. There is also a General Store in near the north campground which sells good ice cream by the cup or cone. There is also an old vintage gas station (it closed years ago) near the campground.
If you want to ride a mule into the Bryce National Park, you can arrange to do that at the private company just outside the park."

It offers views from many vantage points, for those who can only make short walks on level ground, to those who want to make strenuous hikes into the Hoodoos. I went in November, 2017, and in the mornings there were virtually no tourists hiking among the Hoodoos. As the days progressed, yes, there were more tourists but it was not flooded. If you have the physical ability to do so, definitely take some of the hikes into the Hoodoos."

My wife and I did the Queens Garden/Najavo Loop, which gives you a great feel of what the park has to offer, most of the trail was shaded for us but we started around 7am and had a great time with minimal people. I would recommend if you are trying to get a good sunset picture with the sky/treeline on one side and the hoodoos on the other, go to rainbow point. We also did the Mossy cave trail and waterfall trail which is outside the main entrance of the park.
Definitely will be park to explore more of the park."

There is no denying that this is a busy National Park. We had recently been to Capital Reef park and so in comparison, this park seemed crowded. But, when we arrived, we were still able to park in the parking lot at Sunset Trail our first day. Our second day, we parked near the lodge. Once parked, here are my recommendations: 1) Take the shuttle to the spots where you want to hike. The shuttle goes in a loop and picks you up within a 10 minute wait (during normal daylight hours) and takes you wherever you want to go. It is very convenient and parking does fill up. If you ever cannot find parking, there is always parking somewhere around the Bryce Lodge and Cabins. 2) We started at the Sunset to Sunrise hike on the Rim Trail. This is an easy hike and it is paved. This is accessible to anyone and you can see the entire canyon. Anyone of any ability, if they only do one hike or only have one view into the park, this is their hike. It can be only one mile total and can take as long as you would like it to. When you are done, you can go to the lodge for drinks and souvenir shopping. If you would like to do more, there are other great hikes, most of them taking you to other ends of the canyon to look into it or further into the canyon. 3) We really liked Inspiration Point which has three levels of height to its hikes and the Navajo Loop Trail. 4) If you do Navajo Loop, it is best at the start or end of the day because it gets hot and crowded, but it was one of my favorite hikes of our two week trip to seven National Parks. Really worthwhile. 5) We stayed at the Bryce Cabins in the park, which were also a highlight but need to be booked at least six months in advance. It is worthwhile just to be able to walk out of your cabin and be a few feet away from the canyon edge and the Rim Trail. 6) We sat between Sunset and Sunrise on the Rim Trail at sunrise one of our mornings, which is a real treat. Bryce is worth a visit."

Parks in Utah. Walking up to the edge of Bryce Canyon is like walking up the Grand Canyon for the first time. Its unreal. The sights never end. I suggest a few hikes down into the canyon to get the full effect. I also suggest if you want a family picnic, take the scenic drive all the way to the end. At the end it sits around 9000 feet in elevation and there are many tables to enjoy lunch on. Make sure you do the entire drive and stop at the turnouts. The hiking can be as long or short as you desire. This park sits at a higher elevation than all the other Nat. Parks in Utah so the temps. here are much cooler. Make sure you enjoy sunset at one of the lookouts but you have to be there 1-2 hours prior to sunset to get the good light in the valley."

This helped us avoid most of the crowds. You can drive the main road or park and ride a shuttle. Maybe we weren't looking, or at the right place at the right time, but we didn't see a shuttle the whole time we were there. Something to think about.
We drove to the end of the road and hiked the Bristlecone Trail. The poor bristlecone pine tree that lasted for 1600 years is now dead, but the hike has so much more to offer. There was one place with a gazebo where you could rest and enjoy the views. The silence was astounding. And the views make everything worthwhile.
There was a rest area with toilets but no running water by the parking lot. If you find yourself in need of more modern facilities, those are provided in the visitor's center."

It continues to offer a truly unique landscape that is dominated by the hoo-doos. Having traveled much of the world, I cannot think of another landscape anywhere that is quite as unusual as this one.
We were there on May 31st and it was quite cold and windy in the upper elevations. There was still snow on the ground in shaded spots. The conditions made it quite uncomfortable for prolonged gazing. Our previous visit was in September, which was far more comfortable. Given the opportunity, I wouldn't return until aa few weeks later in June.
You can use the free shuttle buses throughout the park, but we chose to drive our own car. We felt like it offered greater flexibility, and we had no problem finding parking at any of the view points.
If you are in the area, Bryce is a must see."

All I know is we picked a great time in May to go to Bryce Canyon National Park. It was not too hot, very clear with sunny blue skies.

This goes counter-clockwise through the valley with the steep part first descending downward into the canyon and a gradual ascent at the end. Walking sticks are very helpful for balance and take a couple of bottles of water, trail mix and beef jerky (optional). These 2 trails will take you a casual 3 hours or more. Make sure you have lots of camera memory and possibly a backup battery (don't forget the cable). The park definitely got more crowded and the day progressed.

It's very pretty. Out of Arches, Bryce and Zion National Parks, Bryce was our least favorite. We felt once you saw one area, all the other areas looked the same. It is very pretty though. Just not a place we wanted to stay for more than a few hours. We moved on to Zion National Park early because we felt we saw all we wanted to see at Bryce rather quickly. There is a VERY small town at Bryce to stay at, which was part of the reason we moved on early as well."

The park service is limiting vehicles to 20 feet and providing a parking lot together with a frequent shuttle bus.

You might want to take the shuttle even if you drive a regular car as the parking lots at the viewpoints are often full with newcomers waiting for a spot to be vacated."

Visited the park for 2 and a half days
I think it's enough to see and get the essence of the place.
Was camping outside the park, close by, but with a wonderful view of the Red Canyon in the Red Canyon Campground.
A tent site is 18$ a night. Includes a picnic table and fire ring.
Toilet and Showers are close by.
Started the day in the amphitheater. That has left me speechless and I was eager to see more.
Sunrise/Sunset point is very hectic. Finding a parking spot, means you might need to circle a few times. Be patient. Most of the visitors don't walk the entire trail that's offered.
First trail was a little over 10 miles. Started at Sunrise point, Queen's Garden, Tropic trail, PeekABoo loop (anti clockwise), Navajo and finished at Sunset point.
It's not an easy hike, but worth every step.
Wear long clothes - the soil is like powder and sticks to everything.
Next day I drove to all the view points. Agua Canyon, Rainbow Point, Ponderosa Point, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point and did one Loop Trail, Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon. Got a little lost there with the Rim Trail. Make sure u have a map or direction, so u don't get lost like me 😊.
Last day I drive to Mossy Cave, which is outside the Park. Nice trail and a nice strong waterfall.
On my way back, stopped at the Red Canyon for some more amazing pics.
Take your time in the park and trails and soak the scenery.
Enjoy!"

* There are shuttles from the visitors center, but we didn't need them as the park wasn't crowded at all (we arrived after 3 P.M. on a Sunday). Plenty of places to pull off and look around / take photos.
* The temps were warm but were MUCH cooler at the top as well as windy, so be aware.
* Wildlife everywhere so be careful driving through. They will walk out in front of you!
* If you want to get out and hike, be aware that if you are afraid of heights, or have limited mobility, the drive might be better for you. There are steep drop-offs, lots of switch backs and a big difference in height from top to bottom. Still a wonderful way to see the park.
* If you are going to more than two National Parks, get a season pass at the gate or online for $ 80 as it is $35 per car at each park. It's good for a year at any National Park and could save you money in the long run.
* Awesome place for night / astro photography. Scout some locations during the day and get back there before dark. Set up your tripod and wait for the stars to come out. Use an app on your smartphone like Photo Pills to find the milky way or to see if the moon will be out to plan your shots. You don't even have to walk far from your car in many places!"

For the first time. We stayed in Kanab and that worked as an excellent starting point for several parks. We went to Bryce after having visited Zion the day before. There are clear differences in the landscape/features of each park, as well as the experience you will have while there in relation to other visitors. Zion at times is like an amusement park in terms of lines/crowds when compared to Bryce. That doesn’t mean Bryce is sparsely visited, and as such a plan is a good idea. We are not “serious” hikers, were looking to do shorter (easier) hikes. We arrived at the park at 7:30 AM and found plenty of parking in the Sunset Point lot. This allowed us to hike the Navajo Loop trail while it was still cool. While we were, we hiking made a decision do break away from the Navajo loop and head toward Queen’s Garden and climb out via Sunrise Point. This was due to the steepness of the trail coming down from Sunset. This made for a longer hike but most of it was in the amphitheater and was easier walking. Walking in the basin of this amphitheater was amazing, a different perspective than from above.
We headed back to the parking lot and dove to the visitors center, From there we took the shuttle to Bryce Point and Inspiration Point. After a short lunch at our car, we drove the full length of the park to Rainbow Point, then worked our way back, stopping at the pullouts and overlooks (which are all on the right side when driving back). We were finished by 3PM.
This approach seemed to put us ahead of the crowds (Sunset Point lot was full later in the day).
The views are spectacular and the land features unique. Don’t overlook this park! It’s worth the drive to get there."

And by the time you get to the trail, a couple of hours will have passed and the heat will be EXTREME. There is another option! Bryce Canyon is only 70 miles away (1 hour 20 minutes). We felt as if we had entered another world as we entered Bryce. There were so few people, we thought this park must not be so great or it would be busier. We were SO WRONG! Bryce Canyon unlike ANYTHING you have ever seen, guaranteed! It is absolutely incredible 'you have to see it to experience it' natural phenomenon of thousands of 'hoodoos' rising up to the sky.

We arrived mid-day and were able to get in three hikes of varying distances. You will need water, sunscreen, hiking shoes (or shoes with good grippers on the soles), and a hat, preferably with an elongated back to protect from the unmerciful sun. There are long stretches on the hikes in the shade. It is QUIET as the still of night in the middle of no where in Bryce. You will be enthralled and will want to linger at every turn to capture these images in your mind, and on your camera. If you happen to have a 4th grader with you, be sure to check out ""Every Fourth Grader in a Park"" from the National Parks Service. You will be able to print out a pass that gets your fourth grader and everyone in your vehicle in for FREE. This is good for all the National Parks/monuments/lakes/etc in the Parks System.

This park is very special. The colors and the geology are just breathtaking. Take some time to hike down among the rock formations. (We decided to take the Navajo Loop, and were a little disappointed to learn that Wall Street was closed due to a rock fall, so ended up going down and up the same switchbacks).
It's definitely a good idea to drive out to road's end, then take in each of the photo stops along the road (which are all on the right hand side as you make your way back towards the entrance to the park). Just know that Bryce will remain with you long after you leave the park."

We recommend the shuttle. The shuttle drivers were friendly and informative and seemed like they liked interacting with visitors. We marveled at the view below us at Inspiration Point and walked on the rim trail to Sunset point where we descended into the canyon via switchbacks to “Wall Street”. My wife is 67, and I am 72, but we did find the way down treacherous or taxing. Make sure we wear shoes with good ankle support. We passed some young adults with flip flops, and they had their problems when it came time to walk back up to the rim trail. We walked past vertical walls on either side of the Navajo Loop Trail before we reached the bottom of the canyon at South Hall. We paused for rest and water and were amazed to hear other visitors speaking Dutch, French, German, Chinese and Czech. I speak German well, and I spoke German almost every day during our two-week national park tour. Everyone loves our National Parks! The trail slowly ascended through another vertical canyon until we reached the dreaded switchbacks that we knew were coming. It took a long time, with many stops to replenish oxygen, before reached the rim trail, but it was worth it. What a great hike!"

First sunset was from Sunset point and we were surprised that it was not very crowded (perhaps it was still early in the season) - you can read my review under ""Sunset Point"". Next morning's sunrise was from Bryce Point - that was probably the best place to view the amphitheater from. We got there about 45 minutes before sunrise and had no problem finding spots to set up our tripods BUT remember to dress warmly - it was cold. After sunrise, we proceeded to Paria View and that offered special views of its own. For sunset we went to Inspiration Point (at the highest lookout) and I used a telephoto lens to isolate features in the amphitheater - very different from using a wide angle lens the previous day. The next morning we hiked part way down the Fairyland Trail and each of us picked a spot from which to capture images. Since we hiked part way down the trail, we were shooting across to the rocks instead of shooting down from the previous three locations. A different perspective that we enjoyed. The park is a simply amazing place and a must visit if you are in the area."

The restrooms were clean and the trails were well maintained. It appears that the visitors center is powered by solar. I didn’t get to ask but I noticed a huge mobile panel outside. I stopped at the scenic viewpoints on my first day. I came back a second day and did the Bristlecone Pine trail. I stopped back by the Natural Bridge site as the clouds and lighting offered a more dynamic view compared with the day before. I then drive down to the “Amphitheater” and did the Navajo/Wall Street trail starting at Sunset Point to the Queens Court to Thor’s Hammer and then on up to Sunrise Point. It was a really scenic hike and not too difficult. The most difficult part is the ascending climb at he end.
I was there during the start of the Astronomy Festival. People with telescopes come at Night and set up telescopes and they allow people to look through them and see the stars. It was super cool! I saw Jupiter and Saturn with its rings. I also saw a few other galaxies and a star nebulous."

We took a ton of photos and stopped at every pull-out on the 18 mile drive, and we visited the lodge so we could say we saw it. Lovely.

Admission fee is $30/car and they provide u with good maps and info. You can also take the Bryce shuttle for free with pick up locations outside the park. You can hop on and off.
If you are planning to go and stay inside the park I recommend you reserve on line as soon as possible. The Cabin was my favorite though the motel room is also fine. The rooms do not have air conditioning but it gets very cool at nite so leave the windows open. There was a fire place in cabin but we didn’t use it. Coffee pot with coffee and cream and sugar packs were included. Our 2 double bed cabin was very clean and rustic. A nice closet had a sink and vanity with hair dryer. Cabin had a nice full bathroom. Nice high ceiling fan. Also a little porch to sit and relax. There are cabins close to the rim, maybe 100 yards at the most. Which come in very handy. We spent 2 days. Best advice is to get up early and get started before the crowds. I was up for a sunrise hike by myself. Very safe lots of folks around. We drove our car out to the furthest - Rainbow point. Ate our breakfast in a little shelter situated at the rim as it was windy and a little chilly in early am. We. Walked bristlecone trail. Visited Yovinpa Point and did part of Riggs spring Loop Trail. Spectacular views. We stopped at all the scenic overlooks on the way back. A few have short hikes you can take (they connect to under the rim trail farther down). This was a good plan for first day to get acclimated to the park. Early Next day we did the Navajo ( Wall Street is a must) and Queens trail. Ate our breakfast during a rest stop. Both moderate trails. Make sure to take water and snacks as a leisurely pace can take several hours. Trails are marked and in good shape. We wore sturdy sneakers and did fine. Both trails can be very dusty so a bandanna can come in handy.
We ate in the lodge both nights early. They Do not take reservations.
Food was very good. A tad on high side. There is a casual pizza place near the lodge as well and other places outside the park. We brought snacks, water etc with us into the park so did not visit the general store. It was hot during the day and cold at nite and early am so dress in layers and bring sunscreen and a hat. The sun is very intense.
Hope this is helpful and you enjoy your visit. We sure did!"

A truly spectacular and wonderful spot with so many amazing things to see, nature can be stunning. The different colours of the formations are truly out of this world.
There are several roads you can take, each one showing different views and plenty of pull ins allowing you to stop your vehicle and take photos, and just gaze in wonder! Be aware though even in early May these pull ins were very busy so you may not always be able to park first time to admire the views.
We have seen some truly amazing sites in Canada and Alaska, and Bryce Canyon is up there with them. This is a must see location!"

I decided to shuttle in from Ruby's at about Noon. So I took the shuttle to Bryce Point. You can drive to the points but I wanted to walk and go along the rim from Bryce Point to Sunset Point and then back to the Visitor Center, where I caught the shuttle back to Ruby's just before 5 PM. If you do this, be aware that much of the trail is on gravel or dirt and there is a bit of uphill walking, but not much. The views on the walk are amazing and varied. By walking you can stop anywhere on the rim to see amazing vistas and take photos and videos. This walk will pass the other rim views accessible by both the shuttle and auto. You can even do more than this by taking the rim trail farther to Fairyland Point. But I hadn't the time. The Fairyland loop is another option. It will take you down from the rim into the canyons and then up again. You can begin the access here either at Sunrise Point or Fairyland which is outside the park entry and not accessed via the shuttle. Lots of people do one of the loop canyon trails down and up from Sunset Point. You can also drive out farther to other viewpoints, such as Rainbow. The shuttle does not continue this way. But sometimes with your own vehicle, you can meet a ranger at Rainbow Point for a day hike. Refreshments on this walk are either at the Visitor Center or the Lodge area by Sunset Point. So don't walk without drink and food to chomp on."

The views are simply spectacular, like nothing else in the world. Definitely walk the Navajo/Queens Garden trail if you are at all able to do so, and visit the various observation points.
Some of the pluses of Bryce: it's not as hot as most of the other parks, due to its higher elevation. It's also not as crowded as Zion; while they do offer a nice bus service, parking was doable within the park (this was a summer weekday).
The only drawback on this trip was missing out on the sunset views, as a thunderstorm rolled through in the afternoon and spoiled our plans."

Was a very big day driving from Salt Lake City to Bryce and onwards to St George.
Driving to Bryce Canyon we drove through Red Canyon which was a teaser to what we would see at Bryce.
It cost us USD 30 to get into the park. I would advise getting an annual pass if going to multiple US national parks (cost US80). The line up wasn’t to bad.
There was buses available to visit the canyon, but we used our car and found parking available. Albeit I don’t think we were at the park anywhere near peak!
The natural beauty of Bryce is just amazing. We walked the Navajo Loop which was a demanding hike but worth it for the views.
Probably not a hike you should do if your don’t have a medium level of fitness.
However you still get amazing views from the top of the canyon.
We probably should have spent a little more time in this park, but we still had a two hour drive to St George. So after hiking for 120 minutes we made our way out of the park."

Other than that, it was a perfect visit! It wasn't as crowded as other parks and the weather was beautiful. The hiking is absolutely breathtaking here; the Hoodoos are like something you have never seen before and every corner is different with a new surprise. There are biking trails all over Bryce & we actually rode our bikes from an RV Park outside of the National Park straight to the trailheads. If you can get a reservation...their Canyon Trail Rides are amazing! We have rode horses in many different places and this was, by far, the best company we have been with!
Bryce Canyon National Park is listed as one of the darkest places on earth, so wish that you don't get a full moon so that you can take full advantage. They actually have a specialized Ranger Force that are experts in everything celestial. Bryce Canyon has Night Sky Talks, Astronomy Programs and Geology Talks so don't forget to check the Visitor's Center while planning your visit.
There is plenty of water and restrooms near all of the trailheads, we never had any problem with that, just remember your water bottle.

At Bryce Canyon Entrance grab a map this will show you all the stops on the way. Some have hiking trails other are just vista points. At the Bryce Canyon Lodge turnout there are picnic tables and nice bathrooms.

All of the park employees I encountered were friendly and very informative. The lines to enter the park were not bad although midday they were getting longer. Unlike nearby Zion, there is ample parking available. The many trails down over the cliffs are relatively easy hikes although in the high elevation, the hike back up can be strenuous, depending on your fitness level. I very highly recommend Bryce Canyon. Like Ebenezer Bryce said ""It's one hell of a place to lose a cow""."

You can see some of the best amphitheaters here even if you're in a wheelchair or hobbling on crutches. The most popular trail from Sunrise to Inspiration is accessible and even allows dogs. You can go into the canyons from there, but you don't have to - you'll get a great view from almost any point. If you're like me and can't handle steep downhills, do the rest of the Rim Trail - the less traveled part. Park (or shuttle) to the other parts and get new views that are amazing. There's no bad hikes here. And don't miss the top - it's a bit taxing at 9300 ft, but worth the drive. Take a picnic or buy one at the camp store - plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view. And bring your camera."

The colors and sandstone at Bryce are surreal! The smooth rock and deep Canyons are hard to walk away from. I could not take enough pictures while we were here!

The biggest thing I would have liked to know, is that there are no grocery stores within an hour or more. We eat very clean and prefer to pack our breakfast and lunch.

We hiked the Navajo Loop combined with Queen’s Garden which is a must see! The park is so much more beautiful from below! We started on the Navajo Loop which meant we were going down the switchbacks, instead of up.

This park is situated in the South of Utah, and his name came from the man who built his house near the area - Ebenezer Bryce.
Actually, what I saw in this park isn't some canyons, as I have learned at the school.
Here I saw many amphitheaters with the weirdest relief shape, you can imagine.
Also, the color of the rocks are amazing - white, red, orange, so on.
With the tourist bus, I climbed from an observation point to another, from 8000 feet (2400 meters) to almost 9000 feet (2700 meters).
The spectacles from every observation point are fantastic - maybe Bryce Point to overcome the other points - Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration. That's because the Bryce Point being the highest observation point (8800 feet - 2640 meters) dominate the all ensemble of the amphitheaters.
Sometime, I believed to see some castles, towers, soldiers, hammers, so on, in all color tones.
The feeling with what I stared at this kind of miracles was impressive."

We did a week road trip of Utah and this was our last stop before heading back to Salt Lake City. So glad we put this on our itinerary!!
We drove to the end and then stopped at all the viewpoints on the way back. The perfect way to do it, that way you save the best for last. Lots of parking, tons of things to take pictures of, lots of hiking trails. Most of the viewpoints are wheelchair accessible and several like Sunrise & Sunset Points and Bryce Point are quite big.

The bathrooms their are clean and parking was easy. The shuttles came often. We road to the Bryce overlook, which was the shuttle's last stop, and walked over the rim to the peekaboo trail. It took us 3.5 hours to walk it. Fairly strenuous but breathtaking. If you start from the last stop like we did when you get to the peekaboo loop stay left for the best views then catch the Navajo trail back up to the rim. Take it slow, bring a walking stick, make sure your shoes fit. The down and uphill can crunch your toes into the front of your shoes if they don't and you sure don't want blisters... Take water. Once committed it is all uphill to return or continue."

Upon arrival, we drove the scenic drive out to Inspiration Point. Stunning views. We also stopped at the Natural Bridge scenic pulloff. It was worth the stop. Beautiful. From there, we headed to the main lodge to check in. We opted to stay the night to see the night skies and the sunrise over the amphitheater. After check in, we hiked the Queens Garden and Navajo loop trails. A very fun hike, but not for the weak. The hike down and back up is strenuous, but we enjoyed all the fun twists and turns within the amphitheather. Viewing the hoodoos, walking through the arches, it was nature's art, and it was fantastic! We stayed in the sunrise building just outside the main lodge. We were within 100 yards of the amphitheater so we went out late night to see the stars and again at sunrise to see the sun come up over the amphitheater. Many other reviews said the sunset and sunrise was a critical part of experiencing Bryce, but I am not in that category. It was fine, but if I had to do again, I could have spent 6-8 hours at Bryce and moved on. I didn't feel I saw anything different at sunset or sunrise that I didn't already see during the day. I would say get there early in the day and move to your next destination by late afternoon. If you do decide to stay, I recommend Bryce Canyon Lodge for food. We had dinner and breakfast there. Both were fantastic!"

We parked at Ruby's Inn, bought our passes and took the free shuttle into the park. We decided to do the moderate Navajo trail and added Peekaboo at the suggestion of a fellow traveller. The views were spectacular. We passed through wind tunnels and got unfiltered views of the hoodoos. This trek is not for the weak-hearted. It is strenuous and has sudden elevation changes. Carry plenty of water and snacks and take frequent breaks. Dress in layers as it gets warm and cold and the weather changes are as confusing as the elevation changes. We finished the hike in under 2 hours and slept for 4 hours after that. Yes, it was that strenuous.
Ok, I am sure everyone is curious to know what the meh was - the shuttle driver asked everyone where they were from. There was a couple from CA. He said to them- hey people around here dislike you guys, so if someone stops you, just say you are from elsewhere. He repeated it again in case they had not heard him the first time. As they got off he told them not to feed the bears. Even the guy from France who spoke in monosyllables got love :-((
Sorry shuttle driver - you had something nice to say about everyone except CA. Not nice .. Be kind to all the states. If you nothing nice to say, at least do not be rude."

I was speechless at the views. We started at the top & worked our way down, stopping at each lookout point. We pretty much did everything you could do by car, in one packed day.

I want to come back & do some longer hikes, would obviously require staying 3+ nights.

We parked up at the handy shuttle car park in Bryce (it’s a small place, you can’t miss it). From there we used our $80 National Parks annual pass to board a shuttle bus free of charge and it took us into the park. We got dropped off at the visitor centre, watched a 20 minute film about how the park was formed and then headed to the 4 key points of the park as highlighted by their website. These points are Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point. We took a shuttle to Bryce Point first, where we walked a part of the upper rim trail before heading back to the shuttle. We then headed for inspiration point and walked from there back to the Visitor Centre (stopping off at the General Store at Sunrise Point for food on the way). This whole trek took about 4 hours and it wasn’t strenuous at all. There are more strenuous hikes available for hardened walkers but that’s not us!"

You cannot imagine its beauty. You must experience it. Be sure to hike down into the Canyon. If you are short on time, hike the Navajo Loop Trail for an up close look at the Canyon's out of this world hoodoos. Every step you take presents another photo op. If you are not up for a strenuous hike, walk along the Rim Trail, take in Inspiration Point and drive the Park Road stopping at all the amazing viewpoints. If you're staying in the area, be sure to step outside at night and see more stars than you likely ever have.

This latest visit was disappointing. The Dining Room still has a very nice atmosphere, but the food was absolutely sub-par compared to prior visits. Our bread was cold and tasted stale. The salad was not fresh. The main course of salmon was served along with bland mixed vegetables and rice, colorless, no garnish. It was not attractively served. We take responsibility for the dry, overcooked salmon, as we like our fish cooked through, not translucent. Our waiter was rushed, he misunderstood our wine request and he seemed upset that we asked him to bring us the correct wine. Last year we had a waiter who was obviously very experienced and made the dining experience much more pleasant for us. Also, (and certainly not the fault of the hotel), there was an extremely loud guest holding forth at an adjoining table, who probably ruined several other guests' dinner. A solution to this problem could be requiring resort casual dress, no t-shirts and flip flops. People who dress better, behave better. This would be more apropos for a classic old lodge dining experience. Frankly, the entire ambiance of the hotel has changed. No cozy fire in the fireplace, even though it was a chilly evening, the lights were way too bright in the lobby, and outside terraces very, very dark. Softer lighting inside and lamps on the outside terraces would improve the charm of the place considerably. We stayed here several years ago, but switched to a different hotel in the last couple of years, so cannot report on the rooms. Also, want to mention that when you walk into the lobby, the desk clerks do not look up to greet the guests. Very cool welcome indeed for guests who want to spend money in your establishment!"

But my advice is to be forewarned, that the hikes that go down, must come back up!!! And it is steep, with high altitude, and is tough for us normal folks!!
Take several bottles of water, several snacks, hiking poles might be helpful if you have some, but not needed. There are plenty of places to stop, lean, sit....or flat out lay down if needed. Haha.
But Holy Hoodoo’s, this place is an amazing display of nature at its best!!
I think these formations rank 2nd only my favorite Sequoia Trees in Yosemite!!
I would be careful with young children, if they are not good at staying close, and listening....there are monster sized cliffs and drop offs, and loose gravel that could be slippery if they are running or roughhousing. And the result would not be good. Think worst case scenario here, if they were to fall over an edge!!"

The weather was cool, with snow and wind one day. Hiking was comfortable, however, with layering. The sights and hoodoos are amazing. To truly appreciate the beauty, one must hike down into the canyon, although there is a well maintained road running the length of the canyon. The trails are wide and well groomed. There are a variety of trail lengths and difficulty. All are well documented in the park newspaper. Be sure to carry water as this is a desert region. Maps of the trails are available at the Welcome Center. You can also speak with a ranger about various hikes within the park and at nearby state parks and national forest facilities. There are many educational displays in the center and a well stocked store. Ranger talks are scheduled daily, more so as the weather warms up. The rangers are friendly and very knowledgeable. Free bus service to town begins April 13. We stayed in the park at the lodge. It was pricy, but comfortable and well worth the cost to be within walking distance of trails and the restaurant. It was also more relaxed and less touristy than Ruby’s, although Ruby’s has an amazing store. (Were warned by multiple people to avoid the restaurant at Ruby’s) At in the lodge restaurant, service was quick and friendly and the food was delicious. Also ate at Bryce Canyon Pines, outside of the park. The Pines lived up to the praises we heard from everyone recommending an off site restaurant. Pie at the pines is amazing! Spring and fall are much less crowded at Bryce than summer. Also found the park less crowded than Zion National Park. We spent three days hiking within the park, another visiting nearby trails outside of the main entrance. Weather did not cooperate for a sunset view of the canyon. We had heard how spectacular sunsets were from numerous people. A wonderful experience."

We just happened to see a tour the afternoon we arrived and were driving around the park on our own. We found out it is a completely free bus tour that is part of the Park - it runs once in the morning and once in the afternoon for about 40 people - first come, first served. You must call to make a reservation - information in the Bryce NP website. It does not go through all the park sights but hits many of the major ones and lasts about 3 hours depending on where you are picked up. As an adjunct to doing parts of the park on your own - I highly recommend it for the information the guide provides and the opportunity to let someone else do the driving so you can just enjoy the views. The tour stops at about 6 spots for photos and some walking along with information about the park from the guide/driver. April was our guide, who is a local and a fountain of knowledge about the park (and tells a few really awful jokes.)"

The tips
1. Start early so that you can find parking.
2. If the parking at sunrise and sunset points are close, park at the SUNSET LODGE. the lodge has extra parking and is between sunrise and sunset points.
3. Enjoy the hike on the rim at different Scenic points around the Canyon as it look different from each of the points.
4. We did not hike all the way down but Go down from Sunset and come back up from sunrise that is better.
5. The hike is moderate not easy.
6. If you planning to go to multiple National parks- Take an annual membership, as it is cheaper than paying $30 for each park."

You begin to wonder whether the architects of the fabulous castles and cathedrals in Europe somehow drew their inspiration from these natural wonders. The color is constantly changing with the movement of the sun. The hike down into the canyon is moderate and only takes about 1.5 hours; a bit strenuous on the way up. The park has a lot of nice viewing spots you can reach by car or shuttle; it is a very expansive park but the primary hike is in a central area near the Lodge. You can easily see Bryce on a day trip, unlike Zion, which can keep you entertained with hikes for days; but it is worth seeing because it is so unusual.

What a mistake we made. First off, it takes about 2 hours to get there, after you get through the main entrance of Zion. It is an absolutely incredible drive, for sure, but you can't get to Bryce early enough to catch the sunrise over the amphitheater or try to get ahead of the crowds. (Sunset would have been an option, but did not relish the idea of navigating the windy canyon roads after dark.) Definitely not as crowded as Zion, but the most popular trail, Navajo Loop, was jammed at 930 AM on a Thursday in April (see separate review.) After our hike, we drove further into the park, and the traffic thinned out considerably. There are so many wonderful hikes at Bryce with views that are incredible and vastly different than Bryce. Red Canyon State Park down the road also looks amazing. If you are planning Zion and Bryce, and you want to hike at Bryce, do yourself a favor and get lodging for a night or two right outside the park or at the lodge or campgrounds."

My husband and I spent a day and a half at this park and I loved every moment of it.
The sunrise at Bryce Point was just amazing, it's definitely inspiring and relaxing to see the sun come up and change the appearance of the hoodoos in the Bryce Amphitheater. We didn't get to see the sunset, but I think it would've been equally as amazing. I loved Inspiration Point and the Natural Bridge, just standing there in the serene stillness and thinking about how these natural pieces were formed was very special.
It's not a very big park and it's definitely doable in a day. If you get a chance, stop by the visitors center and speak to the ranger to ask about Sunsets and Sunrise and their recommendations of where to go. Getting those tips, definitely made the visit so much easier and catching everything we wanted to see.
Since Bryce Canyon is out in the middle of no where and the closest town is about 30 minutes away, you may want to consider bringing food and snacks. There are general stores around but if you're not wanting to pay those prices and prefer you're own selection of food, it's easier to just bring it in a cooler or stored in your car."

The majestic views from the rim will take your breath away. The elevation is from about 7700 - 8500, so plan accordingly; the weather can change quickly. We had sunshine, strong wind, and snow in April. Because we only had one day, we did not hike down into the canyon, but I would have loved to. There are even horse tours that looked fun. Parking in the park itself is very limited, so take the free trams which run about every 15 minutes. The drivers are very nice."

Absolutely stunning! Our first day it was overcast and very windy but still absolutely amazing. The completely unique geological features of the windows and hoodoos were amazing to see and the scale of the canyon is breathtaking. We hiked the Queens Garden trail and the Navajo Trail and stopped in at both Sunrise and Sunset Point. There is parking at most of the stops but on a busy day it is best to park once and ride the shuttle between stops.

At the south end you have great views of the Great Staircase that starts here and ends at the Grand Canyon and some good hoodoos. We stopped at about one half of the pull outs and view points.

Bring along your patience and consideration of others. When you arrive at the park you are given a map. If you have not made any plans while in the park prior to arriving, you will want to spend some time looking at the map and determining what your goals are while you are there. If you have minimal amount of time in Bryce you will probably want to catch as many of the major viewpoints as possible. If you have more time, you may want to walk or hike one of the many trails in the park. Some trails are easy and others require some serious effort. Choose a trail that works for you. We had a short day and a half in the area and immediately set out goals on seeing all the vista points. We drove to each location and experienced only some minor difficulties with parking. If a parking area is full, move on to the next viewpoint. Don't waste time waiting for a parking spot. The Sunrise and Sunset vista points are the most and consistently crowded. There are great trails at these locations and I would advise you to get there early. Some of the trails here are up to 8 miles. You can understand that people who park here may be there for the entire day. Parking spots may open up but they are few and far between. Each view is unique in it's own way and worthy of a stop. We chose to take the Bristlecone Trail which is at the highest elevation in the park. The trail is partially paved and does have some inclines but for the most part this is an easy trail. It's about 1 - 1 1/2 mile loop and offers some amazing views. Take this trail at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery at every turn. It is spectacular. Bring along lots of water and if it's sunny, some sun screen and a wide brim hat are advisable. Some areas offer some views that may cause a little anxiety for someone who has a fear of heights. Just look the other way in those areas and you will be fine. I tried to capture many of these areas in photos but nothing compares to being physically present in the surroundings. You will be awestruck. Support our National Parks. They are treasures to be shared for generations."

You should, too!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g143015-d1925256-r573608696-Bryce_Canyon_National_Park-Bryce_Canyon_National_Park_Utah.html","Apr 2018 • Couples","Since the Civilian Conservation Corps labored during the 1930s to build tourism infrastructure in this remote National Park, Bryce Canyon has been among the most popular, with good reason. Seeing photos simply can't do it justice. There's something inexplicably moving about confronting the palette of dramatic colors, the variety of stone textures and the sheer drama of vistas from the rim of the canyon.
The popularity of Bryce Canyon is both its blessing and its curse. The park is among the best organized in the country, with outstanding, efficient, frequent and environmentally friendly free shuttle service to every major vista point. But the park's popularity also means it gets crowded in summer. We visited in April, after the spring break rush, which proved a good time to be at Bryce. The traffic pattern for personal vehicles is likewise well planned. I strongly recommend driving to the southernmost viewpoint upon entering the park, then working your way northward again through the day, because all the viewpoints are along the northbound traffic lane. Hiking trail markings are clear, and there are trails suitable for every fitness level, from multi-day backpacking adventures to less-than-a-mile strolls along paved and level paths... all with incredible views and countless memorable photo opportunities. The visitors center is small, but highly informative; rangers smilingly answer the same questions day-after-day from visitors, and a variety of publications offer more than enough information about the park for anyone from a casual tourist to a scientific expert. Enormous new solar panels outside the visitors center follow the sun and offer an up-close lesson to youngsters about renewable energy.
We especially enjoyed an easy 1-mile morning walk along Bristlecone Loop at the far southern viewpoint, where stunning high-level views of the canyon were interspersed with tranquil pine forest scenes in an area devastated by fire in 2009. On this walk, you'll see a living Bristlecone tree that's 1,600 years old! Don't miss the Bryce Amphitheater, either; it's not a ""theater,"" but an enormous stone formation comprised of thousands of multicolor ""hoodoos."" Inspiration Point offers both a short, easy walk and a strenuous climb to an even higher overlook. Natural Bridge is famous for its huge red arch formation, but equally impressive are the views from Bryce Point and Paria View.
The park offers camping and a lodge, but limited facilities are booked up months - or a year - in advance. It's very possible to ""do"" Bryce Canyon in a single day, as long as you stick to the rim viewpoints and are not planning any of the arduous, long hikes. Bring lunch, if you can. Food service is somewhat limited. If you can swing it, try staying for dinner at the Bryce Canyon Lodge; the dining room does not offer any views of the canyon, but the food and service is quite good, if on the pricey side.
Bryce Canyon National Park is among the most expensive in the system, but it's well worth the $30 entry fee per vehicle."

Much smaller crowd. Easy hike. water in awesome rocks. Great.
2nd, the spring break crowd at Bryce is a huge issue. They basically don't think it is economically worth it to staff things 100% until May 1st (start of summer). So you run on a skeleton crew, for a 150% capacity crowd. Yeah. You can see how that ends.
Sunsets at Bryce....don't really happen, so stay at the lodge.
Sunrise...awesome. Don't miss it.
If you do the Navajo - Queen Loop, go counterclock wise. There is a HUGE difference in hike intensity. Counterclockwise = gradual climb. Clockwise has a 1 mile grind up a steep....and I mean steep.....slope.
If it is crowded, get up early, go to the trails during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Zig while they zag. They are predictable sheep in a big heard. One thing that did surprise me....they wall wake up late. The real crowd doesn't arrive until about 10 am.
Also, there is no shuttle until May 1st. read some other bogus review saying there was a shuttle. There is no shuttle."

I highly recommend that you go on this trip on your own so that you can see all the beautiful spots in Bryce. There is never enough time on a bus tour, and we only saw Sunset Canyon. Was very disappointed not to see the Ampitheater and other spots in BC. I recommend spending 1 - 1 1/2 days to see BC, definitely with a minimum of one night stay. Also, going on Sunset Canyon, please keep in mind that the deeper you go into the canyon, the harder it is to come back up. It is an 8,000 foot elevation and the air is thin. It is very easy to meander the downward direction into the canyon, but going back up is a different story. But I'm sure for people who are physically fit, it is a no brainer. Have fun!"

We were there when there was still snow on the ground and landscape and to us, it just added to the beauty. Bryce is a small park ... only 56 square miles, so it's really easy to navigate. We followed a recommendation to head directly up the main road to the top observation area of Rainbow Point (about 30-35 minutes from the entrance) and then came back down, allowing us to avoid left-hand turns into and out of the lookouts.

Do NOT use the toilets. They are disgusting, they are dirty, they are not looked after at all. A bunch of people were just gaging including us.
You can smell the portopotie stench even standing on ledge overlooking the canyon. Its rediculous.
Glad I saw it once but your public land being whored out by the government to make money period. Park service? Maybe they should be trained to brush the toilets to earn our tax dollars or take a part of the $30 crime price to enter the park.
Enjoy the fermented latrine aroma throughout the park!"

The views were gorgeous. We did a hike into the canyon which is well worth the time. You get a great perspective and it wasn't too strenuous. We checked out the viewpoints stops up to Bryce Point. It was absolutely breathtaking. It was quite busy. The weather was a bit cool but comfortable. We couldn't imagine what it would be like to be here in the summer with the heat and the crowds. Try to go off season when it is cooler and less busy."

We didn't have a lot of time to spend there (just a stop on our way to an AZ art show), but were able to see nearly every major stop on this enormous orange canyon. To me, it was more impressive than the western part of the Grand Canyon and also Zion (which, because of time constraints and physical limitations, we were not able to hike and fully enjoy). If you can't make the hikes at Zion, and must choose between Zion & Bryce, I'd choose Bryce. Don't get me wrong, Zion is breath-taking and a must-see, but this is quicker with fewer lines, and you can drive to many points of interest, which you can't in Zion. There are also walking trails here as in Zion, but they're probably shorter."

The bright coral-colored hoodoos that populate this area of southern Utah are like nowhere else. While the park itself is located in a remote area, once you've arrived at the park the viewpoints, trails and services are easy to access. We visited in mid-September and the weather was perfect. The park was quite busy but we still managed to find some solitude in the southern section (I don't think the commercial tour buses go there). We stayed at the Best Western Grand Hotel (see separate review) at Bryce Canyon City, just outside the park entrance, and spent one full day in the park. We got up early and ate breakfast at the hotel, then drove our personal vehicle into the park at sunrise ($30/car valid 7 days, accepts NPS passes). The scenic drive (Route 63) skirts along the rim of the Bryce Amphitheater for 18 miles and there are about 15 viewpoints or overlooks along the way (see below). Not much is visible from the car so in most places you have to stop and get out, but the walking distances are short. The majority of the viewpoint walkways are paved and suitable for wheelchairs or strollers. We drove all the way to the south end of the scenic drive at Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point first (about 18 miles one-way), and it was very quiet when we were there - we only saw one other gentleman. We then worked our way back north to Bryce Canyon Lodge, stopping at the sights along the way. There weren't any crowds until we reached Bryce Point and Inspiration Point; these were much busier since the shuttle buses go there. We ate lunch at the lodge (see separate review), visited the gift shop for souvenirs, and then walked on the Rim Trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point, and on the Navajo Loop Trail into the hoodoos (that .5 mile section of the Rim Trail is paved and wheelchair-accessible but the 1.3 mile, moderately-difficult Navajo Loop is not). Next we drove to Fairyland Point overlook (just inside the park entrance), then visited Mossy Cave Trail (outside the park entrance on Scenic Highway 12, 1 mile easy round-trip footpath to small waterfall and grotto, not wheelchair-accessible).
Some Points of Interest, north to south, on Bryce Canyon Scenic Drive* (* indicates attraction has a separate Tripadvisor page):

If you don't have a lot of time, I suggest driving into the north part of the park and stopping at Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, Bryce Point, and Paria Point. These sites are close together and offer amazing views of the hoodoos in the amphitheater. At Sunset Point there is the opportunity to walk down among the formations, such as Thor's Hammer. These are popular areas, so try to go early in the day if you can because the parking fills up.
Between mid-April and the end of October there is a free shuttle that operates between Bryce Canyon City (Ruby's Inn*) and the main points of interest in the north end of the park. The wheelchair-accessible buses run every 15 minutes from 8:00am to 6:00pm or 7:00pm depending on the season. Parking is available at Bryce Canyon City if you want to leave your vehicle and ride the shuttle into the park (you still have to pay entrance fee). The shuttle stops at: Ruby's Inn, Grand Hotel, Ruby's Campground, Bryce Canyon Visitor Center, Sunset Campground, Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Bryce Canyon Lodge, and Sunrise Point. Note that the shuttle does not go further south on the scenic drive (Route 63) past the turn-off for Inspiration Point and Bryce Point. However, half-day bus tours that go all the way to Rainbow Point are available twice a day (reservations required); call 435-834-5290 or inquire at the shuttle station or Ruby's Inn in Bryce Canyon City.
There is a paved multi-use path that goes from Bryce Canyon City/Ruby's Inn to Inspiration Point (about 5 miles one-way). This path goes past the visitor center, North Campground, Bryce Canyon Lodge, Sunset Point and Sunset Campground. It's possible to park or stay at Bryce Canyon City and ride a bicycle into the park (entrance fee applies). Rentals are available at Ruby's Inn.
Lodging and camping is available both inside the park and just outside the park entrance at Bryce Canyon City or at the nearby towns of Tropic and Cannonville. The park is very popular so the accommodations stay booked up; reserve as far in advance as possible. A wide variety of recreational activities and programs are available both in and around Bryce Canyon; inquire at Ruby's Inn and the park visitor center.
The elevation at Bryce Canyon varies between 7700 and 9100 feet. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness (fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, etc.). Take it easy and drink plenty of fluids.
Note that pets must be attended and leashed. They are only permitted on paved trails and surfaces."

Be sure to see that canyon at sunrise and sunset for incredible views and amazing photos.
The paths are very narrow and a small slip or misstep can land you way down at the bottom of the canyon. Bring good shoes and maybe even a walking/hiking stick to keep your balance. If you have fear of heights, a hike here is not for you. Regardless, there are many viewpoints of the canyon that you can go to without having to hike."

We went in mid-September thinking that most of the crowds would have died down. We were very wrong. As always, we hit the park shortly after sun-up. We managed to get to the Navajo Loop and complete the trail before it got too busy. On our return back up from the bottom of the canyon we notices many more visitors gathering at the top of the canyon. We continued on along the Rim Trail and were stunned by the amount of people. There were so many that it actually made the loop difficult to navigate, so we hopped back in the car and went to the next overlook. By the time we got back in the car, the parking lot was full. Numerous tourist buses were disembarking passengers and it made it hard to get in and out of parking areas for the remainder of the trip thru the park.
Some of the viewing areas are basically peep holes in between stands of trees. We were unable to get to some of the lookouts due to other visitors monopolizing them. We tried to ask politely to be excused as we tried to pass on the paths but due to language barriers (or just rudeness) they declined our request. Keeping this in mind, please remember to get a good look, take your photos and move on so all can see."

Requires at least 1/2 day and best to have a full day. The road is scenic, but it is essential to viewing the world-class scenery by parking at the various overlooks (""Points""), getting out and walking variable distances to the canyon rim, typically 100-300ft distances. Most are doable with canes or modern wheelchairs. Well advised, if able, to take at least a short hike down to develop perspective of the landscape and hoodoos. Even 400-500ft would open a landscape page. At night, be sure to walk or drive away from lights to see the best display of the Milky Way in the 48 states (it's furthest from cities). Foreigners especially who never see the Milky Way Must do this, as so many have never seen this miracle. If short on time, then better to not drive the length of the road south and instead, e.g.: 1) visit Sunset Point, 2) Inspiration Point, 3) hike down from Sunset or another point such as Sunrise. Caution on hikes down: harder on knees, but at least 4x harder on heart/lungs on the return trip up. The elevation is 8-9K, so it is also much cooler than lower elevations such as Zion, so clothing choices have to be considered."

Snowshoeing here in the winter is our favorite and especially when there is a full moon. The white against the red back drop is lovely. If you have people with you who do not hike there are locations to park and walk a short 300 yards to worthwhile and scenic overviews."

The hiking among these ice and water-weathered lithic giants. These lithic (rock) giants were formed from Cretaceous period limestone, siltstone, dolomite, and mudstone which are the types of rock comprising the varied shapes the Claron Formation exposed here for hikers to get up close. Several trails take you above, below and among the pastel colored pillars called hoodoos in some places because of their shapes. Flash floods are a concern in the wet season because of the steep sided slot canyons and extensive breadth of these watersheds over which the rain may fall. Some rocks the size of cars suggest the power of ice and water on these millions of year old weathered rocks."

It's something I'll never forget. Three reasons we loved it:
1. The hoodoos - these columnar, gothic cathedral spire-like rock formations, carved by water and ice, were like nothing I'd ever seen before. The pinky-orange and white landscape looked other-wordly, and the interspersing of these pastel rock spires with conifer trees and a glorious blue sky overhead was unbelievably beautiful and any photographer's dream. While I'm quite pleased with some of my photos, none of them do justice to the sheer 'wow factor' of this canyon. I'll never forget my first view out over the hoodoos from Sunrise Point, a short walk from the car park. By the time we'd walked over to Sunset Point a few minutes away (the better view, for me), I was completely blown away by it. I don't think I'd ever get tired of looking at Bryce canyon. You'd see something new every time. I'm usually cold if it gets to less than 10C. I stood for over 90 minutes in -4C temperatures, cold but mesmerised.
2. The sunset/sunrise - Certainly in late early Dec, you want to be prepared to be standing around in the cold. It's a good deal colder than Zion or Page either side of it, and I was glad of the full layers, thick coat, scarf, hat and gloves. I'd really recommend having gloves you can use your phone wearing, as it stops you getting quite so cold taking photos. We saw both a sunrise and a sunset, and the sunset was the winner for me. I'd looked up the time and sunset was at 5.10pm, so we arrived at 4pm and walked over to Sunset Point, to set up a tripod. Actually, some of the best photos we got were with our phones. The important thing was not to assume the colours of the sunset would arrive right on the time sunset was forecasted. A lot of people were looking round as the sun finally disappeared at 5.10pm, and thinking 'is that it?' Some people left. I couldn't see how a sky as clear as that and a sun as bright as that couldn't give as a pretty view, so we dug in and waited. It was probably~20 mins (felt like hours in the cold) after the sun had gone that the sky started to do its thing. Then it moved pretty quickly. The sky first went an amazing pinky-purple, and then a deep orange (see photos). The effect of the light over the hoodoos was breathtaking. We kept looking at each other like we'd wake up at any moment. Well worth the wait. Our hands and feet were frozen as we stomped back to the car to warm up, but it was 100% worth it. The night sky, with lots of stars on the walk back to the car, was fab too. Sunrise was good, also at Sunset Point, and I went down the start of the Navajo trail to take pictures of Thor's Hammer as the sun came up (see photos). It wasn't quite as dramatic as sunset, but still pretty cool as the sun first clipped the top of the hoodoos. I'd expected the 'Thor's Hammer' hoodoo to stand out a mile, but there are so many strange and unlikely shapes in these stone pillars that it wasn't that obvious.
3. The trails - The whole Canyon is laid out as a set of viewing points. Sunrise, Sunset, Observation and Bryce Points are pretty close to the carpark. I'd go for Sunrise and Sunset if no other. Sunrise first gives the sheer size of the Canyon. Sunset is soooo pretty. We drove up to all the other points in the car, hopping out for a look. They are variations on a theme, but I'd definitely recommend the Natural Bridge. That is really different, and very cool. We walked Navajo trail from Sunset Point as we were time-limited. It's a bit over 2km and you walk down a big slope and then back up it. The views were very worthwhile. You pass through quite different sections of landscape, from walking down a fabulous path between towering red cliffs, to getting close to the hoodoos. Some bits are wooded, some are all about the rock. The final slog back up was a bit tiring, and all those layers can work against you at that point (we had to stop and de-layer several times as the sun rose), but I loved it and wished we'd had time to walk more in this area. That said, if it's cold or you're not inclined to walk far, you can just drive and look, drive and look.
We stayed at Ruby's Best Western (perfectly fine) and that was a short drive away, which was perfect for nipping up to the canyon for an early start, and getting back quickly afterwards to thaw. If you are considering having Bryce on your itinerary, I really can't recommend it enough. It's completely unforgettable. We arrived mid- afternoon (to enjoy the drive from Zion in the day - a fab drive) and did the sunset on our first evening. The next day we got up and did the sunrise at just before 7am and the Navajo Loop walk, which took us to about 11am. We then spent a good 2.5 hours driving up the rest of the trail, to look at the other points including the fab Natural Bridge, leaving the Canyon at about 1.30-2pm for our drive on to Page, arriving early evening. An extra day here, or even half day, would have been brilliant as I wanted to do more walking."

Stop by the welcome center when you enter the park for a great exhibit on the geology of the park and how it formed over 100's of millions of years."

If you travel here be prepared for snow. Tends to linger here for awhile. This park is at pretty high elevation. I recommend hiking the Navajo Loop Trail. Beautiful hike down amongst the hoodoos.

So if your planning on staying here plan ahead. Very nice hotel just outside park entrance. This park is pretty remote. So get your supplies before hand.

The Navajo Loop Trail is a short and easy but very interesting trail through a unique landscape; it takes you to one of the most famous rock formations, Thor’s Hammer. I explored the longer Peak-A-Boo Loop on horseback, but that one is also good for hiking if you want to spend an extended time around the hoodoos.
It is a 30 min drive from the park entrance to Rainbow Point (which marks the end of the road) with several viewpoints along the way. I took about 2 hours for the round trip which was just enough to briefly stop at all of them and take some pictures.
Altogether, I had one afternoon and a full day in the park and I got to hike, ride and take the scenic drive which was like everything I wanted to do."

If you enjoy natural formations and taking pics, this place is paradise. Start out early and see the Sunrise from ""anywhere"" along the Rim from Sunrise to Sunset point !! All great viewing areas!!!! After sunrise head back and fill up on a big breakfast and then head out on a full day hike. I recommend heading down Via Sunrise point and do the Navajo loop Trail to Peekaboo loop trail and come back Via Queens garden. It's a looong full day of hiking but it will leave you endless views and pics. We took over 1,000 pics combined as every few steps u simply can't help but to do a 180 look around to enjoy the incredible scenery. Although a long hike you will be stopping to take tons of pics and get plenty of rest. *Midway thru Peekaboo you will encounter some bathrooms* The hike up is definitely harder than down so just pace yourself and if you are doing in hot temps bring plenty of water 1/2 gallon to a gallon for sure a hat, sunblock and consider an umbrella to shade you ( looks funny but works excellent ) Grab a great meal after rest up and go back to see sunset ** always different every night. This will be your highlight day for sure. Enjoy!!!!"

Goal today was to spend most of the day in the canyon area and get some good sunset pictures. We were there in mid September. First recommendation definitely use the shuttle. Parking is free at the shuttle station. Thankfully I have a senior pass for entry. Shuttles were running about every 15 minutes at each stop. Traffic and parking inside the park was congested and many times certain overlook site areas were closed to traffic due to overcrowding of cars. Shuttles however, ran everywhere all the time. First stop was the visitor center then on to Bryce Point as there was a storm moving into the area. After a brief visit at the point got back on the shuttle and almost made in back into the Lodge before the hail storm. We waited for the storm to pass and had lunch at the lodge. As clouds persisted we decided to come back in the early morning to visit the view points and to hike a couple of the trails. Rim trail was being worked on so part of the trail was closed. There are a number of trails available to walk, strenuous to easy, that will fit all. Who knew that rock could be so beautiful. The wonder of hoodoos and rock spires. The colors were brilliant and the formations of stone were inspiring. Depending on the time of day and the cloud coverage color of Bryce Canyon seemed to be always changing. Never did get to see a good sunset at Bryce, so sad."

We've been in Bryce canyon several times, at different times of the year, and every time it is amazing again. Although majority of people view it from the rim, the trails going down are majestic.

Mix of red-orange-purple-rose-white hoodos, stone castles, creatures, figures, vast valley and high plateaus, deep blue skies, and shimmering greens of ponderosa pines are owe inspiring.

We were staying in Springdale by Zion National Park but we had to make the day trip across here to Bryce. You also get to pass by Red Canyon on the way which looks like a mini version of Bryce. Its only a 2 hour drive each way and you get to drive the amazing Zion-Mt Carmel Highway (Route 9) out of Zion which has some of the best views in the World!
Back to Bryce - the place is one giant Amphitheatre that you get to view from above in all its glory when you arrive if you park at the Sunset Point trail head parking lot. We arrived around 10am on a Saturday in November and it was very quiet at this time, there were lots of parking spaces available.
The view from Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point after you complete the Queens Garden/Navajo Trail is just like nothing else on Earth. The photos don’t do it justice you have to experience it for yourself.
It is also worth a ten minute drive South down the scenic route 63 to Natural Bridge which has its own parking lot at the side of the road.
Although the elevation is 8000-8600 feet here you don’t feel any lack of oxygen in the air at all, in the Fall anyway and I doubt you would feel light headed unless you are very sensitive to this.
Bryce should really be on your bucket list if it isn’t already!"

Have to see it to believe it. We went to all of the parks on our journey (Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Canyonlands, Arches) and this was my favorite. It's so different from Zion - in Zion you in the bottom of the canyon looking up in amazement and hiking up - at Bryce you are on the plateau above the canyon and can see into the canyon and hike down into the canyon among the hoodoos. The stunning colors, the unusual formations, the hikes - you must do a hike if you are able, all make Bryce a site to behold. We stayed in the North campground and watched sunrises and sunsets from the rim and did several hikes along the rim and into the canyon.....am amazing life experience."

It's about a four hour drive, and a stunning drive at that. We traveled in early November, which is considered the winter off-season, and it was noticeable. Many of the restaurants and hotels were closed. I prefer the lesser crowds at this time of year anyway. If you have just a few hours, then drive to Bryce Point, at the far end of the park, and stop at all the stops on the way back to the main viewing area between Sunrise and Sunset points. If you have more than a few hours, then take the Navajo Trail hike down into the canyon too. It's magnificent to see the hoodoo formations from up close. I would suggest a full day or two half days at this park if you want to see it all. We have visited many national parks and found this one to be as spectacular as the others."

The parking lot next to the Visitor Center was crammed, with all spaces full and idling cars waiting to pounce on any space that came free. The Visitor Center itself was packed. It was all just like a shopping mall the day before Christmas. So we just grabbed a map and set off for the General Store to get a cold drink after our 5-hour journey. We discovered that all the parking spaces nearer to the Amphitheater were already taken, so we left the car at the Store and set off for the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop Circuit, which was truly spectacular. But once we had completed it in the afternoon heat, we were done for the day. A friendly ranger told us this was not really the best way to do Bryce Canyon, and gave us some tips for the next day.
So what a difference we found the next morning. We’d arrived as suggested at 6am this time to take in the view from Sunrise Point, and saw the Amphitheater in a whole new light, with vivid colors that contrasted with the washed-out mid-afternoon light of the day before. A quick breakfast at the nearby lodge and then straight to the far end of the park at Yovimpa Point, where it was still so early that there was nobody there – but still a bit chilly, so take a jacket. Here we took the Bristlecone Loop, but not too fast, as it’s over 9000 feet. Then we worked our way back along the ridge (despite its name, the park is really a ridge overlooking hoodoos on either side) taking in the sights. By 2pm the crowds were back, and we were ready to leave the madness behind and head to the hotel for a siesta!"

There is some parking spread out throughout the park - and shuttle buses may be the best option when the park is busy. This is an extremely popular NPS location, and there are a ton of hotels, services and camping locations. There also is good handicapped access to the main attractions.

The hoodoo formations are so unique and special, each and everyone different and they change color over the course of the day. Just walking a few feet gives you a whole new perspective and view. One could literally take thousands of pictures here and not get bored - very challenging to get a perfect shot. I love sunrise and sunset best when the tips of the hoodoos look like they are glowing. Did a few hikes here too - it's great to see them from below, they are so large and majestic. The color combinations and contrasts here are amazing. It's like a symphony made of rock and limestone. Nature is amazing. Only negative is it can get way too crowded which spoils the experience a little. Go in the off season, or on a weekday, and give yourself at least a full day, preferably two....and go to one of the less crowded lookouts, as they are beautiful too and you might get some solitude too."

You may want a jacket for the shaded areas and the uphill part where the wind blows.
If it is available, I HIGHLY recommend doing the Bryce at night get together. The park rangers had the telescopes out from 9:00 to 10:30 pm and showed us the different stars and constellations. It was so great! The rangers were very informative and it was amazing to see the craters of the moon so closely! I can't wait to come back!"

The views from different points of the park and trails changes with every bend and with every hour of the day and changing sunlight.
If you are short on time or don’t want to hike a lot, then choose the queens trail canyon - a moderate 2.3 miles hike which takes you up close to the hoodoos. Carry alight jacket in and after oct as it tends to get cold at the bottom, when all sun is blocks by steep cliffs.
The best sunset I think is from the Inspiration point rather than the namesake “ Sunset point”
A word of caution - the gift shop at Ruby s Inn, right at the park entrance is exorbitantly priced for Knick knacks and mementoes. Try and buy them in any of the major towns nearby. If driving to Vegas, Kanab downtown has wonderful shops where the same things can be found with much more variety and significantly cheaper."

The altitude is high and can cause some issues for those who are sensitive. It was also cold and windy so be prepared. There are several trails down into the canyon for the adventurous, but not for us. We were more than happy on top.
There is a nice information center and the Bryce Canyon Lodge inside the park is beautiful. They have a great gift shop,restrooms and restaurant. It is vey crowded and difficult to get in so book well in advance of your trip.

You stay a little closer to nature, there are walks to the the floor of the canyon that are not too strenous. The hoodoos and the warm red-ocre colouring is unique and beautiful. We stayed for two nights in order to catch a sunrise, tour the sightseeing points by car and go down in the canyon. We got the very useful tip to descend via the steep Navajo Trail and take the less steep Queens garden trail up - that way is definitely best.

Had only 1 hour and 50 minutes at the main canyon rim. It has a visitor center with flush toilets. Parking lot was crowded with tour buses and tourist vehicles. Located near the park's Lodge.
This is a federal national park so there is an entry fee per car.
Rock formations look like gigantic termites ate into the sandstone formations. It is about 0.8 miles down to bottom. There are NO railings or fencing along the switch back trails. If you slip and fall, it can be a long way down. I only had time to go halfway down. The rim is about a 1/2 mile hike along the edge. There are scheduled ranger talks about the park conducted along the rim.
The view is superb. If you have about 4-5 hours then you can easily hike down, along the bottom trails and back up again to the parking lot.
Warning: If you hike down, there are no outhouses or water sources along the trails."

We stayed the night in Panguitch and it was an easy drive in. The park is fairly small and we only spent half a day there although I’m sure you could spend a couple of days happily. It’s not as large and doesn’t have quite as much to see as some of the other, more famous, parks such as Zion, Yosemite and Yellowstone where you can easily spend 3-5 days. Regardless, it’s a lovely park that’s easy to get to, get in and park at. As we only had half a day, we did the Navajo loop trail that takes you around the rim briefly and then down into the hoodoos and (most impressively) down Wall St and back out again. The views are incredible and unlike anything I’ve seen before. It can get steep at times and very hot if you do it at midday - bring water. You can either take it clockwise (turn left when you enter) or anti-clockwise (turn right). We went clockwise although it seemed most went the other way. Allow 1-2 hours for the hike. The start of the trail is well signposted from sunset point parking lot, where there are also good toilet facilities.
A very enjoyable visit and I would like to return to try some of the other hikes."

After lunch we walked down to the floor of the canyon. Fortunately, our lunch server at the Bryce Lodge told us the best trails to take. Even then, it was quite a difficult hike for this middle-aged mom to get back up to the top. Bryce was not like any other National Park we visited. We sure got some great photographs!"

We only had an afternoon; but I feel we really got a lot in. We booked the RAINBOW POINT SHUTTLE tour bus, that left @ 1:30 p.m., and lasted until around 4:00-4:30 p.m. Jay was our tour guide and he was really great.
This National Park stands out with all the various hoodoos, and red rock formations. Many different vista points you can pull off and see on your own, or if on the shuttle, they will take you there, give you some information, and then on to the next.
Don't miss this wonderful park if you are anywhere nearby!!"

It's around a four hour drive to Bryce, and I stopped at Red Canyon for a 90 minute hike (beautiful and really empty once you get 10 minutes from the parking lot)... Bryce will cost you $30 to enter... if you have the entire day, it probably is a good idea to take the free shuttle bus around... by 1300 on an October weekday, some of the viewpoint carparks were already full... But I had really limited time so kept my car.... stopped at just two viewpoints and walked hard! Stunning rock formations, views of around 100 miles and like Red, once you got 10 minutes from the parking, it was largely empty. Literally breathtaking - you're up at near 9000 feet and there's 30% less oxygen than you're used to...!
Take the best camera you can because smartphone cameras just don't capture how wonderful this place is.
My day here (and a Grand Canyon visit) make me want to spend 2 weeks travelling the National Parks around here. Can't wait to go back."

The free shuttle is worth using, we caught it to Bryce Point (8296 feet above sea level) and walked back along the rim via Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Sunrise Point, at the stop we went down on the Queens Garden Trail to Queen Victoria which was 1.8 miles to the end and 357 feet down, of course then you have to walk back up but worth it. We then walked to the General store for an ice cream and then walked over to The Visitor Centre to catch the shuttle back to Ruby’s Inn. The easiest walk along the rim is from Bryce Point as it is mainly flat or downhill, you can stop at any point and catch the shuttle which run every 10/15 minutes. Stunning views around every corner of the “Canyon wall or fin”, “Windows” and “Hoodoos”."

We got there early in the morning and parking lots were near capacity. Rangers were beginning to turn people away.
Many people just enjoyed the view from the rim. That is special, but if you have the physical ability to hike down one of the trails, do so. We hiked the Navajo Trail. It was steep and a bit tiring, but not technically challenging and do-able for anyone with reasonable fitness and proper footwear. Carry water.
That hike plus stops at every one of the viewpoints right up to the end of the road took us all day, leaving the park as dusk approached. You could do the park in less time if you just stick to the viewpoints closer to the park gates."

I experienced Bryce two ways: all day at the park and a half day. If you are limited for time and only doing a half day unless you get there very early I would park your car at the visitor center and then take the shuttle to either Inspiration Point or Sunset Point. You can then walk along the trail at the top of the canyon. This is a paved walkway with many amazing vistas. The main reason for taking the shuttle is that the parking lot at Sunset Point fills up quickly and you don't want to be wasting time looking for a parking space when you could be viewing the canyon. If you have time remaining you could then drive further up into the park to different viewpoints. If limited for time I don't suggest driving any further than the Natural Bridge.
If you have all day and are in halfway decent shape you should definitely do the Queen's/Navaho Loop Trail. Going down into the canyon give you a completely different perspective of this beautiful park. I would suggest starting at Sunset Point and ending at Sunrise. That way you go down through the canyon which I believe makes it more dramatic.
If you are anywhere near this park make sure you stop even if it is for a short period ot time. You will be stunned and amazed at the beauty."

The largest selection of hoodoos anywhere to be seen. It is strictly not a Canyon as it has only one side however it consists of many canyons or amphitheaters. The colours range from subtle pinks to vermillion and palest creams. It's soaring crags and shapes are highlighted by the Pinion and Ponderosa pines which grow on the Canyon floors. Winding their way through these sandstone edifices are countless trails which are easily accessed by walkers who do so in their hundreds. The blue skies assensuate the towering sandstone pillars giving the whole spectacle a wonderful 3D effect. To add to this natural wonder is the wonderful sense of silence you feel walking through this incredible landscape. Use the free shuttle service which is a hop on hop off bus allowing you to enjoy the rim and all it's wonders. You can do as little or as much as you wish. A trip to be enjoyed by all ages and abilities. Be prepared for the large crowds which flock here all year round especially during the months from spring to late October."

Lots of people going to the same places to see the same things. The Number 1 Attraction which is a MUST is the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop Trail. The Rim Trail which is 11 miles long can be taken in sections as desired.Bryce Point is a popular & busy photo shoot.
For a more quite, less busy, easy hike, go to the end of the 18 mile park road and take the Bristlecone Loop Trail (1.0 mile). A surprising great short hike was the ""Mossy Cave Trail"" which is on Hwy 12, 5 miles east of the turnoff to the park.
The Visitor Center has park personnel to answer questions, a store for postcards, books, etc & flush toilets. The 18 mile Rim Drive has multiple overviews. There is some lodging, campgrounds, a store & restaurant inside the park. There is an excellent paved hiking/bike trail through the park, to Bryce Canyon City and all the way through adjacent Red Canyon.
Bryce Canyon City is a couple of miles outside the park. There are multiple hotels, restaurants, shops, gas stations, etc here."

Although there are a number of hiking trails, you can see the ""hoodoo"" rock formations (and a huge natural arch) that are the main attraction by driving through the park to the different scenic overlooks. The park spans 17 miles (there is only one entrance so you have to drive back once you reach the end). This can be done in just a few hours, or you can spend a day or two hiking down into the canyon itself.
The hoodoo formations themselves are amazing; massive formations carved by water in an ""amphitheater"" canyon presenting vistas almost as awe-inspiring as the Grand Canyon. This is definitely a park worth visiting that should be seen in person.
The entrance fee is a flat $30 per car, which is a bargain for a family, though a little steep as a solo traveler."

I do not believe there are rock formations similar to these anywhere on earth.
This park is very personal as it is easy to be fully submerged into the park and it’s wonders. The Grand Canyon is great but too big to feel personal. Yosemite can get close to Bryce but more crowded and not quite as easy to touch.
We stayed at the lodge which was four cabins in one building. All separate entrances. Rooms were excellent for a National Park. The dining room at the lodge was also superb. Staying there is the difference between a great trip and a good one.
The views are less than 100 yards from the rooms and are simply spectacular. Google some of the great pictures of this place. Many trails that easily get you to the floor of the canyon and near the rock formations without too much difficulty. Colors are magnificent and accentuated at sunrise and sunset. You really can see most of what you want to see without needing in park transportation.
Make sure you see salt and pepper on the way in or out."

We stayed 3 days, drove around one, got rained out the other and hiked the last. Two days is plenty unless you want to do a lot of hiking and make no mistake the hikes are great. The first day we took the free Rainbow Point Bus Tour which goes from the entrance to the far end of the canyon. The views were amazing plus the driver's extensive geological information. I highly recommend it, especially since it's free. The night stars out there are magnificent. We were going to do their Ranger Guided Astronomy Nights program, but the handout they gave us when we entered said it was 3 hours long starting after sunset. The next day I was talking to a ranger and she said she was in charge of the program. When I mentioned we had declined because of the length she apologized and said it's a misprint. The program starts with a short lecture followed by telescope viewing. The attendees can leave anytime they want, next time. If you're planning on going, take a look at all the other close geological state and national parks nearby. You could easily spend 10 days seeing it all beautiful stuff in this area, especially Zion National Park."

The parking lots at the turn-outs were almost comical with how confused people were and the lines of cars waiting to get in. Tour buses everywhere so better to drive the road early morning or late afternoon. That said, of course the scenery is spectacular. However, if you are doing a tour of Southwest Utah...I would just do this in a half a day - or less, as much of what you see here, you will see later on Route 24 or at Capitol Reef, the Grand Staircase or Canyonlands. Honestly, you could to two or three stops inside Bryce and be done. If there are no crowds...go ahead and drive the entire distance...but otherwise, I would ditch it and continue on up to Capitol Reef. We regretted staying two nights here.
The real find in this area is Kodachrome State Park about 10 miles away- you get an up close look at some amazing rock formations and can drive on some amazing level but unpaved roads through spectacular, uncrowded scenery. If you camp, you absolutely want to go to Kodachrome.
The biggest problem with Bryce is the lack of any low key, attractive/interesting lodging. All there are is about four large commercial hotels and their billboard, flashing signs (the place is in the middle of nowhere..so no, we are not going to miss your honking large hotel!). The choices as to where to stay are limited and Ruby's Best Western clearly has the lion's share of the hotel market here. The plus side is that Ruby's has Everything: a massive restaurant, a huge - and nice gift store, a grocery store, a post office and a few other services. Also, we stayed in the ""main lodge"" and the room was large and very clean. The down side is the commercial feel of the place, the mass of people and the kitschy nature of the place.
In the evening, being a captive audience, we went ahead and signed up for the Western singing performance across the street. A bit weird but very entertaining! They have a generic buffet and some country western guys sing on stage. You sit a tables with people you don't know which was fun - so many people from other countries~!
If you can avoid staying anywhere near Bryce for the night...you will probably be happier!
(If you are doing a tour of most of the parks in Southern Utah..it is definitely worth it to get an annual pass for $80 dollars. )"

We booked before we left home to do a 3hr horse ride doing the peekaboo loop which we knew went down into the Canyon but never in our wildest dreams we expected it to be like that, I remember sat on my horse at the back of our group just taking in the scenery and I could not believe we where actually riding amongst all those hoodoos! Having not ridden a horse for many years I was a bit nervous at first especially as they tend to walk right on the edge of a sheer drop most of the time but after a while I relaxed and just let it get on with it, we did have a water stop half way round before carrying on back up to the Bryce Canyon Lodge where we started from. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horse riding, and as there were only about 12 in our group you never felt rushed in anyway, the leader kept stopping after so long so we could all catch up and re group. After the ride we went back to Rubys Inn where we where staying and picked the car up and drove through the National Park starting at Bryce Point and working our way back stopping at the various View Points, I must say some got very busy with cars but we were lucky enough to find a space in each of them and Wow the views where just unbelievable . There is a Shuttle Bus that you can catch that will stop at each place if you didn't wish to take the car. I would recommend anyone to visit Bryce."

We got there mid-day on September 14, 2017 in a thunder storm with hail on the roads and trails. The snowplow was out, strong wind, and sleet hitting our windshield. Determined to see all we could see because this was our afternoon to see Bryce. Our first stop was to be Inspiration Point, we missed the sign and ended up all the way to Swamp Canyon. I didn't know there was a Swamp Canyon, put our rain coats on and took a look. Cold and shivering we returned to our car and went back to find Inspiration Point. Now we saw why we missed the sign which said Sunset Point and Inspiration Point all in one sign and just one turn-off road for both (our map didn't show it that way). We had no problem parking, only one other car in the lot. We went to all the overlooks we could find over there, no hiking like we planned because the trails were covered with 1/2"" thick hail and little rivers running down them. I dropped my camera I was shivering so hard. Then we went to Sunrise Point, we drove in and could not find where we were suppose to go for the scenic lookout. There are many buildings there with names and we finally pulled into a parking lot with the name ""Sunrise Unit"". I asked a man in the parking lot if this was where we should park for the scenic lookout. He said yes but he didn't recommend going there because we could get hit by lightning. I said it's now or never because we may never get back here. I was very surprised walking to the edge of the canyon and got to the edge of this steep cliff with no handrail in sight. Then we went on to Fairyland Point and I thought it was the best of the bunch. We learned you can get great overviews without hiking at Bryce. We also learned that: plan an extra day somewhere on your trip to account for rain. Then we stopped at the visitor's center but that parking lot was full so we couldn't go in there. I am giving Bryce 4 stars because of poor signs and no handrails in some places."

Even if you only have a few hours to spend there, I would definitely recommend going. My group only had about three hours before we had to head to the airport to catch our flight home, but we were able to see the highlights anyway.
The Navajo trail will come up as highly recommended whenever you do a search on this park and I can enthusiastically confirm that this absolutely spot on. It is a short, 1.4 mile trail, but it gives you some spectacular views and takes you all the way into the canyon. Even though it is short, the ascent on the way back is rather steep so make sure you have lots of water and take lots of breaks because the elevation can definitely mess with you if you are not used to it. If you have time, you can extend the hike to include the Queen's Garden trail as well, the two combined are extremely popular.
Before we set off on the hike, we also took in Inspiration point and, again, this is highly recommended as it gives you a great overview of the entire span of the canyon and you can get some fantastic pictures there.
This is a gorgeous park that makes you feel like you are on another planet, I can't wait to come back here again and again."

If you are able to take the more strenuous trails down into the bottom of the canyon then you will be amazed. Hoodoos, slot canyons, winding paths, fabulous rock formations and great colours. All just beautiful. We really enjoyed the hikes to and around Queen's Garden, Two Bridges, Tower Bridge and Wall Street.

The free shuttle bus system works perfect and will take you to all major points in the park. I recommend using it since the park has limited parking space.
I can recommend the queen’s garden trail and the rim walk from Bryce Point to Sunrise Point. Take the shuttle to Bryce Point. This is the descending route. Note that if you walk the rim the other way around you will be hiking uphill."

Scenic views, amazing rock formations, trails, wildlife, changing weather, indescribable vistas.
Get there early, find a parking space, and then ride the buses and hike the trails. Much less crowded than Zion or Grand Canyon, combine that with better hikes and more unbelievable views. What's not to love?
On second thought, stay away! Don't want it to get too crowded..."

Bryce is unlike any other park I've seen. The hoodoos and rock formations are so varied and unique. You can drive through the park's 18 mile road, and stop at the 12 or so well marked overlooks. There are also shuttle buses. Most people drive to the end of the canyon and then stop at the overlooks on the way back as then the overlooks are then on the right hand side.
Don't miss Sunrise and Sunset Points, about 1/2 a mile away from each other at the rim of the main canyon near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Walking along the rim trails provides fabulous photo opportunities.
One great hike combines two trails: start at Sunset Point, down 580 feet of S-curves to the Navajo Trail (rated moderate) and puts you at the bottom of the canyon with incredible hoodoos! Seeing them from the bottom of the canyon is a whole different experience, not to be missed. This trail connects to the Queens Garden tail (rated easy) so that you come up at the less steep (approx. 370 feet of climbing) Sunrise Point. The two combined are just over 3 miles and doable in 2 hours give or take, ,depending on your hiking level. You'll walk through a couple of stone doorways that make this hike more unique.
There are hikes for every level. Note that elevation may be a factor: Bryce Canyon is at approximately 8,000 plus feet in altitude. It is a spectacular experience and one that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat."

Now, I would rate it as a must-see - not as grand as Yosemite or Grand Canyon, but more stunningly beautiful.
It looked great from the rim trail, and even better once we went down into the 'canyon' (really a huge natural amphitheatre). We started at Sunset Point, took the Wall Street trail which linked to the Queen's Garden trail, and were back at Sunrise Point about 2-3 hours later. Actually, I lost track of time, but at no point did I lose the inane grin from my face as I took in one amazing rock formation after another.
Definitely a top priority to visit!"

This place was just as unique as Zion, the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and the other places we visited and we did not walk the trails into the canyon. With envy of the youth of those walking the trails of the canyon we still enjoyed the views and the unique displays of nature in front of us. Oh to be young enough again to fully enjoy this park.

Both times we were once again bowled over by the scenery. Yesterday we couldn't get to Sunset Point or Bryce Point as the parking was full and the Rangers were not allowing anyone else in. But we didn't have that problem today and managed to get to all the view points. As with all the other National Parks we have been to; Bryce is extremely well organised and maintained. The visitor Center was very crowded both times we went in, but they have a good selection of things to buy; useful and interesting information and Rangers on hand to offer advice. We didn't use the shuttle but it seemed to be popular. I didn't use the basic toilets, but there are flushing toilets available at various points! Bryce is great in that even with limited mobility you can get to see so much. And for those more able visitors there are a number of trails.

First was Zion, with Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands and then Arches to wind up the trip. Needless to say, the scenery was spectacular, but for us, the best sights were the hudus in the Bryce Amphitheatre. There is nothing short of the chimneys in Turkey that we've seen which compare to the stark elegance and magnificence of the structures and formations we encountered at Bryce Canyon. And even there, the formations at Bryce Canyon have no real comparison.
The hikes we took were amazing! My wife, who has breathing problems at higher elevations, took in the hikes as well, and the splendor of the surroundings really energized us both. If I had the opportunity, I'd have gone on every hike available, but the layout of the park allows for easy access to lookouts that afford magnificent views. Of all the parks, I think the lookouts are the best placed for majesty of scenery.
My only regret was waiting until my late '60's to go to these parks. And when I do return, Bryce Canyon will be on the top of the list to see yet again."

All different and unique. We enjoyed Bryce Canyon and the views were unbelievable. It is mostly a drive and park adventure with walking views and trails that looked to be for the more experienced hikers. We tried not to miss a stop and so many different rock formations and the terrain was especially different at the higher elevations. These parks all offer comfort stations and if you haven't gone to visit them you are definitely missing out. One thing found in Bryce Canyon that was of interest was the Bristlecone pine tree. This ancient pine tree can be found in Peekaboo Trail, Fairyland Loop and at Rainbow Point. These trees are over 1600 years old. Most views are painted with beautiful rock formations called hoodoos."

Our visit was confined to the areas between Sunset Point and Sunrise Point with the Bryce Canyon Lodge in between. I hiked the trail down from Sunrise Point to Queen's Garden, and then back to the top (via a trail that had a short sidetrack to Two Bridges). Boy, coming up from the bottom of the canyon will utilize portions of your lungs that you all but forgot about! It is a difficult hike simply because you are always unslinging your camera to take yet another breathtaking shot.
When I finished, I met up with my wife in the lodge, where we had just an excellent lunch. We each had BLT sandwiches (they put guacamole in them!), mine with homemade potato salad and her's with a garden salad, and both with a pickle spear. Carafe's of ice water were on the tables, and refilled often. $10 each - what a buy.
We stayed at the nearby Ruby's RV Campground, which was next to Ruby's General Store (Ruby pretty much owns the town from what we could see). You need to see this general store - we couldn't find a t-shirt we liked at the Bryce Lodge gift shop, but at Ruby's - they had 'em."

You park at the Visitor's Center, and hop a shuttle.

From there we hiked to Sunset Point, went part-way down to the canyon floor, then returned to the rim to hike to Sunrise Point. From there we went to the Lodge for a very nice lunch. If we had more time we would have stayed longer, but we had to drive our niece to Salt Lake City to catch a flight home.
Bryce Canyon is known for fantastic rock formations carved by the wind. They have upright formations know as ""hoodoos"" that are unlike the formations at any of the other parks we visited, so I would definitely recommend a day here. They do have horseback trips, though we didn't try that."

The park is stunning, however it is a bit more commercialized than some of the other parks (Canyonlands, Arches come to mind). My advice is to get out of the car and do some hiking. The Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden are the most famous for a reason- they are spectacular. I went late afternoon, which was perfect- I enjoyed the drama of the late afternoon sun highlighting the hoodoos and at times had the trails completely to myself. I have a feeling many people try to go early to ""beat the crowds"" but going after 4 I had no problem on the trails (the roadway and overlooks were a bit crowded though).
Best advice I can give is to go at night. If your timing is right, there is a night sky program run by the rangers that is supposed to be great. I went and unfortunately couldn't find where the program was occurring, but I decided to give it a go myself. It was spectacular. I've never seen the sky look as it did, and I had an overlook completely to myself."

It was stunning and a fabulous example of nature at its best. I think because it doesn't cover such a large area allows you to take in everything much easier. Lots of viewpoints and trail walks allow you to get up close and intimate with the park. Didn't do any of the trails that allow you to descend right into the canyon as my fitness levels wouldn't have allowed it but several of our party who did said it was well worth it. At a price you can always let a mule do the hard work for you as trail rides were on offer. A highly recommended visit."

You've all see the photos and heard all about it, so I will just focus on some tips.
Use the free shuttle rather than driving yourself around the park. Then you'll have no hassles with parking, and can enjoy looking at the scenery, listening to the commentary, and taking photos. Buses come frequently, so its no problem getting around the park.
Get info at the visitor center. That way, you can plan how to do the most with your time. There are lots of trails, so they can point out the ones that suit your needs and abilities. Also, fill up with water at the refilling station -- on hot days, you will need it.
Visit all the observation points. They highlight the key attractions and are close to the shuttle stop points. Easy walking.
Walk at least one trail. My favourite is going from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point on the Navaho trail route. It goes right into the hoodoos past the Queen's Garden and Thor's Hammer. Gorgeous.
Come at different times of the day, if you can. The rocks seem to change colors to give a whole new experience."

Each view point will literally take your breath away, each one is different in there own special way. To fully experience this place a hike is essential, any of the trails I'm sure would offer you a close up experience within the canyon that you will never forget. A top tip is to arrive in plenty of time for the sunset and sunrise view points as these are obviously big hot spots for tourists, and it can be difficult to find a parking space, the shuttle would probably be your best option. I would recommend going to the furthest view point at the start of the day and then work you way back to the amphitheatre to finish with the spectacular sunset."

Just when I thought things couldn't get any more impressive than the others I found the best so far. Even more so than Yellowstone.
Rather than just stop at view points and then move onto the next we had sufficient time for two trail walks. One from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point which is relatively easy and short and the other from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. This was around 2 miles along partly paved tracks and undulated up and down but nothing too strenuous. It can easily be done in an hour or less. The views were stunning from so many points on walk with far reaching views to the horizon and an ever changing array of rock formations in the Canyon.
Do make time for at least one trail walk and you won't be disappointed."

Visiting the weekend after labor day - I was surprised by the busloads of visitors crowding the viewpoints.
While the scenic drive is a nice ride on a motorcycle - there are no direct views of the canyon from the road. You have to pull into the vista points - or even better go for a hike to really enjoy.
The vista points further out on the road (toward Rainbow Point) are less crowded. They provide great long distance views and scenic overviews. But they do not really show the canyon and hoodoos.
The vista points closer to the park entrance (sunset, sunrise, inspiration) provide great views of the Canyon and Hoodoos - but beware of the crowds. Even though I was on a motorcycle, parking at these vista points was difficult. In a car I would have been very frustrated. The number of tour buses is hard to believe.
Next time, I will probably park at the park entrance and utilize the free shuttle to get access to the trails"

UTAH ROCKS and Bryce Canyon National Park is a must visit.
We had 1 day for Bryce and were amazed by hoodoos -
1) start at inspiration point - has best view of hoodoos, go to the top point and not just the parking lot point
2) Bryce point - you may check this out but can skip it if you are not doing good on time
3) Hiking - navajo trail is a must do! Lots of photo ops. Thor's hammer point is a great spot for a picture!
4) sunset and sunrise - hoodoos glow in the sunlight so defined go their for sunrise but if you are not a morning person then check them out during sunset
5) stargazing - this park is magical at night. Even on a cloudy day we saw so many stars. Park rangers also put up a presentation at night near visitor centre which one can attend without any prior reservation and is of zero cost. It can get really chilly so recommend to pack a jacket and coffee to enjoy the night sky
6) wildlife - lots of deers and chipmunks can be spotted around the park. They are adorable.
Parking lot - the one near sunset point is really big so no trouble finding a spot but other lots like inspiration point, Bryce point fill up quickly so plan accordingly."

We parked in Bryce and caught the shuttle bus into the park to Bryce Point, then followed the Rim Trail to Inspiration Point, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point, a route that offered spectacular views of the canyon and amphitheaters beneath.
From Sunset Point, we followed the Navajo Loop Trail down into the canyon which provided equally spectacular views. Being able to explore this part of the canyon, getting up close to rocks and hoodoos formed over millions of years, was a wonderful experience.
One day just wasn't enough. I could have easily spent 2 or 3 days exploring the 65+ miles of trails in the park. I can see why people choose to camp and spend their entire holiday inside the park.

I'd taken more than 500 photos the previous day of Capitol Reef National Park and the Grand Staircase Escalante National Park, and didn't realize we were only thirty miles from the northern edge of Bryce Canyon Park. I made the comment that I wasn't taking any more photos today.
We were barely out of Escalante, when the scenery began to change dramatically. Half an hour later I was shouting that we had to pull over in a turnout so I could take pix of the spectacular scenery. We got out of the car and started a little hike. For the next hour, we continually stopped along Hwy 12 for pix and to climb some of the spectacular formations.
I never knew what a Hoodoo was until we read about them at the Red Canyon visitor center. Just astonishing natural rock formations.
You don't have to pay an entry fee to see the hoodoos and majestic rocky peaks along Hwy 12. The ride is free. At least five (free) hiking/biking trails begin at the Red Canyon visitor center.
If you want to turn off on Hwy 63 and enter the main area of the park, admission is free if you own a Senior National Park Pass. Otherwise vehicles are $30, motorcycles are $25, and pedestrians or cyclists are $15.
This was our 4th Utah National Park in three days, and I'm pinching myself in disbelief over the stunning beauty of this incredible state."

The rim walk is very nice and easy walk with some great views, and there are Park Ranger presentations at some of the vista points that really adds to the experience as they provide background to the park evolution. There is also a free shuttle running along the rim which is great as it let's you park outside the park and skip the worry about competing for the few parking spots in the park. The hikes are a nice mix of short and long hikes which allow you to experience the park regardless if you have half a day or several days. There were quite large crowds when I visited so a good tip is to start early in the day to beat the crows for the more popular walks. Also worth noting is the temperature which can vary quite a bit due to the elevation, every through an individual day so dress in layers."

We stopped at the visitor center first where the ranger widely advised us to go to the most popular place first, sunset point walking to sunrise. We then zipped to the end of the 16 mile drive, checked it out, and drive back slowly, stopping at every scenic overlook. Each one was Wow, and different from the one before. Our final stop before lunch at the lodge (excellent BLT sandwiches) was Inspiration Point. They saved the best for last!

There is a complimentary shuttle service that starts outside of the park that you should probably take as parking in the park can be at a premium especially at prime vacation dates. The only problem is you will need transportation to get to many of the ""view sites"" further in the park as there are photo ops along an 18 mile route. My favorites were Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, Natural, and Rainbow point. We were not able to stop at all the points as we got caught in an afternoon thunderstorm.

There isn't another park in Utah quite like it. The ""hoodoos"" as they are called are beautiful in their own way. Ever changing in different light and weather, you will be amazed by their grandeur. Similar to the red rock you see in Sedona, AZ, but the sandstone on these pillars changes with rain and wind. While it was too warm for us to hike, we enjoyed the 17 mile drive. Best to drive to the very end of the canyon first and make your stops as you head back toward the entry because the canyon is only on one side of the road. Also, everyone seems to stop at the first pull off. It took approx. 3 hours to see the canyon. I will definitely return in cooler climate."

But we had heard some really positive comments about Bryce, some people even finding it more beautiful and interesting than GC. I'm not gonna take part on that debate here, but have to say that Bryce really surprised me with it's beauty. And it's easily manageable...I mean for example Zion can be a total disaster if there is too much tourists. But Bryce is much more easier to handle as you can circle from one viewpoint to another with your own car. You can't do that at Zion and the shuttle service is awful there. There also lot's of different beautiful hike trails in Bryce, some more challenging than the others. Really splendid experience in peaceful and extremely beautiful Bryce."

However, you'll be surrounded by crowds. If you want to avoid them, try the Fairyland area, or Tower Bridge. These are serious hikes, but rewarding.

Our driver, Jay, was really cool and full of useful information. He pointed out the important points in the park and was engaging when he answered tons of questions.
There was a separation of rock from the area of Inspiration point. We were walking along the rim and I was actually able to photograph the slide.

The first two are beautiful but I think Bryce is the most interesting. The Hoodoos, the canyons and the natural bridge pictured above are outstanding. If you still use 35mm film, take several rolls, you'll need them. If you shoot with digital make sure you have an empty chip or at least one that can store several hundred pictures. Again you'll need it.
The park has a shuttle service that can and will take you to almost every overlook. We drove but if you want to sit back and relax between picture opportunities the shuttle is the way to go. The shuttle is free but you will have to pay the National Park fee to enter.
I would suggest you get the National Park pass or the lifetime Senior pass. Either one is $80 but in two or three trips they will pay for themselves. Entry into Yellowstone, Grand Tetons and Bryce Canyon would have paid for the pass."

My wife and I had visited some 20 years ago and it's just as beautiful as we remember.
Since this is a well reviewed attraction on TA, here's some logistical items instead:
1. If you're here during summer, bring lots of water and snacks. It can get quite warm and the hiking and elevation will drain you pretty quickly.
2. Additionally, summer brings afternoon thunderstorms and rain.Nothing terrible but just be aware of the lightning. You don't want to be standing on the rim trail out in the open with lightning coming down around you.
3. If you're going to do any of the hikes, such as the Rim Trail, keep in mind the altitude. You'll be up around 8,000 to 9,000 feet.
4. Pictures. Definitely bring a camera. The views here are spectacular and make for some amazing photos. If your camera or mobile device as the ability to do panoramic photos, you can find some awesome spots to get huge sweeping vistas.
5. Speaking of photos ... the canyon edges are dangerous and are usually covered with loose rock and dirt. Be careful. It's a long drop to the bottom.
6. Parking can be a challenge. It's very limited inside the park Get here early or plan on driving around a lot to find a space.
7. Finally, I would strongly recommend that you park where ever you can and then walk. This is one of those places that's best viewed up close and personal.
This is definitely one of the National Parks you have to stop and see. if you plan on doing at least four National Parks in the area, get an annual pass. It'll pay for itself at the fourth and it'll save a bit of time as well. They'll give you this little holder for the card that attaches to your rear-view mirror so you can just leave it hanging and then visit any National Park in the area."

There are several stops on the bus shuttle trip and you can select exactly which rim walk you want, according to age and fitness.
There are also walks down into the canyon itself,but here you need to careful as the walking is steep and demanding, the canyon floor lies deep down - and you have to walk up again!!!!

Some of them are like castles. Some like the facade of a palace. Nature was so amazing to create these fantastic formations. Not to be missed!"

You can't see hoodoo's everywhere ... We combined the Navajo Trail with the Queen's Garden Trail and don't be fooled: yes, maybe this is the easiest hiking trail in Bryce Canyon, but it is still challenging and steep enough. But it's so beautiful! When we were at the bottom of the canyon, it even began to snow - what a unique experience. I'd love to come back one time."

So just let me add a couple of personal observations and suggestions. (1) Absolutely, if you're physically able, take a hike into the canyon floor. Queen's Garden is the easiest, not all that demanding, but the views from the floor area are spectacular. Adding on the partial Navajo through Wall Street adds to the effort but is so, so worth it. (2) Unless you're a committed backpacker, two days at Bryce is probably plenty. (3) If you're coming to Bryce in the summer from either Zion or Moab, you'll appreciate the heat break; Bryce is around 8000' altitude at the amphitheater, over 9000"" at Rainbow, and considerably cooler than those others. A light jacket for morning hikes is a good idea."

We trekked downwards from the sunrise point. The following day we also did the Mossy trail , the approach for which is outside the park and is about 5 to 6 kms away from the park entrance.
The trek till the bottom was fine and comfortable although temperatures being high, do remember to carry lots of water. The trek up was very difficult and tiring. Came across some squirrels ( known as chipmunks in US) who were aggressive and not afraid of humans. While moving up the canyon we came across very narrow stretches which makes the climb even more difficult. Most of the structures were very awkward looking . At times it looked like a row of people sitting in straight lines."

So are the rest of our National Parks but Bryce is the second most overcrowded NP I've ever been to (second to Zion). Bryce was the first NP where we have ever felt like you were almost forced into taking a bus throughout it. Yes the bus was convenient but the overlooks were slammed and most of the crowds never even looked at the scenery. They waddled off the bus, turned their backs to the amazing vistas and took selfies making sure the background was there. Such a different vibe than Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the like.
Anyhow, Bryce is worth going but if there is ANY way you can go some other time than the summer you will have an exponentially more enjoyable experience."

Spend more time at the pull-outs/overlooks/etc. nearer the ranger station... like Bryce Point. These are the most picturesque, most spectacular. We drove out to the ""end"" and worked our way back... which took some time... but the best was at the end.
Also, try to be there at sunset to see the colors change.

Incredible does not even begin to describe this place BUT to really enjoy it you have to walk down among the hoodoos and other formations and look up. You won't see the best of it just from the rim. BE PREPARED for some steep climbs though!
Heading out of a morning, thankfully with water bottles, snacks and sturdy shoes but sadly no hiking sticks, we had full intention of just stopping at each point via shuttle, going home for lunch and taking the Queen's Garden Trail later in the day. (Hah!) SO with that in mind we got on the FREE shuttle outside our campground (Ruby's Inn) and took it to the farthest point that the shuttle goes - Bryce Point. Wow! What an introduction!
Two of our children decided they wanted to hike down the trail. Good idea? Did we fall for it? Oh yes! Always ready for an adventure off we set. Although the night had been cool the day was warming up quite nicely! The trail that the kids wanted to hike was called the Peekaboo Trail but to get to the start of it you have to walk over a mile down and up switchbacks. (Altogether 5 1/2 miles.) As we walked down we were already dreading having to walk back up.
Once on the Peekaboo we took the left fork as a bathroom was needed. Yes, thankfully, there is one down there available during the summer months! It was only on our return that we read that a ""Clockwise Direction Required"" was actually written on the official Bryce Canyon paper! (Good job we went the right way! The Wall of Windows is amazing as are many of the different shapes and sizes of hoodoos.
At the bottom, at the halfway point of the Peekaboo Trail we stopped for a snack and then made the executive decision we were going to take the adjoining path and get onto the Navajo Loop Trail. There at the bottom was a guide and so we asked him which side was the best to take. He advised us that the left hand side was way more iconic and so off we went. Oh my! What sights we saw and would have missed, including Wall Street, had we not gone this way. It is only 3/4 mile but this one really makes you climb! Thor's Hammer can be seen once you reach the top.
If this is your first visit to Bryce Canyon, like it was ours, we would advise you to visit the Visitor's Center first where you can educate yourself on the canyon, watch the movie etc."

We walked the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden trail. The parking lot in this area was very full so try and get there early to get a spot. We were happy to see drinking fountains with water bottle faucets and you should fill up water while here as there is none available on the hike. Our first glimpse of the ampitheater left us amazed at the natural beauty of the park. The Navajo Loop was very steep but at the bottom it leveled off. The Queens Garden trail was just as scenic.

Parking is tight but there is always someone pulling out, so just be patient.
For day trippers, you can easily spend anywhere from 1-3 hours just soaking in the beauty and walking along the rim. For the more adventurous there are many hikes into and around the amphitheater. If you're lucky you may spot some elk and other wildlife.
It is a long day from Vegas but if you combine it with Zion Canyon you can have an amazing experience in a day trip."

Everybody has heard of Bryce Canyon. And that is part of the problem. There were tourists everywhere and I mean everywhere. Even though we got there at like 6:30 in the morning nearly all the parking spots were already taken. Another thing that's important to know if you are going to go, you need to go at sunset. At Sunrise, the sun is in the canyon and so you can't really take pictures. Even though they have a ""sunrise view,"" that means you can look at the Sunrise, not take pictures AT sunrise. There is no way to take pictures without the sun being in your camera unless you go towards Sunset. It was our mistake, we did not know that. We probably would have been better off going the day before, way later in the day. But There were so many people it was not that enjoyable. Selfie sticks, screaming kids, etc There weren't as many animals, no wildflowers, and the like. Cedar Breaks was such a delight and so if you want Canyon views but also want wildflowers, to have a place pretty much to yourself, have deer Antelope Chipmunks ground squirrels and the like, I honestly would say go to Cedar Breaks and Skip Bryce. But if you need to check it off your list, then at least go later in the day so that your photos won't be washed out."

It was fun to sit in the sun and be cooled by the cool wind blowing out of the canyon. The Navajo Loop was our hike of choice as it allows you to hike in and around the hoodoos, through a few small archways, under 1.5 miles and we had some tires little legs with us. Though many do this hike it is not an easy hike lots of elevation change walking next to drop offs and hiking in loose footing. Bryce Canyon Point Natural Bridge and Rainbow Point are all worth the drive to see. The day we went the rangers had a telescope for us to look at the sun through... we were skeptical to say the least. They had a filter that allowed you to do this without burning your eyes out. Unique opportunity to see the sun, it appeared red and you could see sun flares. Nice visitor center at the entrance of the park to get your National Park Passport stamped and learn a few facts about Bryce. Our only regret is getting ice cream inside the park instead of waiting to get it at one of the shops outside the park."

The hoodoos are truly awe-inspiring, crafted by the elements of weather.
There is a shuttle bus going around the area. If you don't have your own ride going out of the park, be mindful of the last trip.
There are different loop trails to choose from. We took the NAVAJO LOOP TRAIL which is an easy to moderate hike.
If you have a senior citizen with you, that's an extra blessing. They will give you a discount :) Just make sure they have their ID's with them or their Pass, just in case. We only paid $10 for entrance fee.
What to bring:
1. Bottled Water - Note: there is a refilling station in the areas like the Navajo Loop;
2. Camera - Totally a haven for taking landscape photos and selfies. Extra battery pack. You will definitely regret it when you run out of juice.
3. Hat or Umbrella - It drizzles when we went there.
4. Walking stick - it would help because there are some not so steep areas but definitely will help you balance
5. Bring snacks - we had ""spamusubi"" and energy bars.
What to wear:
Walking shoes, light and comfortable clothing. Remember to put on a lot of sunscreen.
Best time to take photos - Sunrise and sunset when the hoodoos are orange red in color.
Note:
****Please be careful not to bump someone's TRIPOD :)
****It is best stop by the Visitor's Center first to watch the video on how the Canyon was formed. That way, you will appreciate the place more.
****And there is a designated place to park your vehicles.
Happy hiking!!!"

We had never seen any thing like this in our 120,000 motorhome travel miles. We took our two oldest grandchildren out West to the Salt Flats, Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Great Sand Dunes and Pikes Peak this summer. Bryce was actually my favorite place.

Such amazing views! Only complaint was that part of the park was closed due to road maintenance in JUNE (which the rangers would not say why, but found out later on the website)?! Luckily everyone in the group was a bit tired of hiking and it ended up being a good rest day. We started at Bryce Point, then to Inspiration Point. From there my son and I walked to Sunrise and Sunset Point and my daughter wife and mother-in-law picked us up at sunset point. The views were spectacular. All encompassing whichever way you looked. We also hiked down a little (without my mother-in-law) down the Queens Garden Trail. Kids were tired and hot, so we turned around about 75% of the way down. The walk-up was pretty tough for the kids and my wife with it being so hot out. We all made it though with lots of water breaks. So glad we all had camelbacks!"

The view from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point is one of the most beautiful creations, almost on the magnitude of the Grand Canyon. Photos just cannot do justice to what your eyes will see. There are many other observation points in the park. Take the time to visit each one. We did not hike the garden, but I am sure it is outstanding up close. This park is a hidden gem and certainly one of the best in Utah, and one should take the time to visit. The Scenic Byway from Bryce NP to Moab is likewise a must drive if you enjoy God's creation. It is breath taking."

Overlooks start as soon as you enter the park and continue as long as you choose to investigate as far as 20-miles into the park. Camping is available with reservations. Hiking provides spectacular views, but does take time and has steep grades. Without off-road exploring, allow 2-3 hours.
We drove to Bryce from Salt Lake City, spent 2-hours in Bryce, drove 1-1/2 hours to Zion National Park, and ended up in Kanab, UT for the night, without rushing, and feeling we had seen both Parks."

The visit almost ruined the beautiful experience due to one Ranger's comment. When we pulled up to the Ranger station to enter the park, my father asked if there were any discounts (such as as senior discount because our grandma was with us, or a veteran's discount since I served in the U.S. Navy) and the Ranger promptly stated ""Yes, but they are for U.S. Citizens only."" None of us gave any thought to the comment until after my father paid to enter. It wasn't until we drove away, that we realized what she had said. She assumed that a car full of Filipino Americans were not U.S. Citizens based on the color of our skin. My siblings and I were all born in this country, I have SERVED this country, and we love this country for all that it has given us. So much so that we give back as much as we can! This is the first time I have ever decided to leave a negative comment on any place we've visited due to the service we were given. I know that this one Ranger's comment does not reflect the thoughts of the people who work at the National Park, however I just wanted this experience to be shared so that it may resonate with those who have ever wanted to assume someone's nationality before asking any questions. I love our National Parks for their beauty, wonder, and it's reminder that we are all just a small speck in this beautiful world. I will come back again to Bryce Canyon time and time again. I just hope that people will learn to respect other's when we come together to share in the wonders of Earth's beauty."

The Canyon is draw dropping and quite unlike anything you'll ever see. We much preferred it to Grand Canyon, far more accessible and every corner you turn the view is different.

If we were planning on staying the whole day we would have done that. We got there late afternoon so parking wasn't to much of a hassle.

This was our first trip back and we brought our 17 year old daughter, 21 year old son, and his fiance. We all had a wonderful time. There were a few serious storms and downpours but they only added to the beauty, wonder, and positive experience. The park is big enough and the storms isolated enough that a dry trail was easy to find.
I have to give high praise to the park staff. They were fun, well-informed, enthusiastic and helpful. Seriously, we were all so impressed.
Like other National Parks suffering from over-crowding there is a shuttle bus system in the park. Our visit was crowded but we were able to find parking spots with little or no wait.
We drove out to the very end of the park to Rainbow Point and hiked a short loop trail that offered stunning vistas.
Mossy Cave: This is an easy hike with mild elevation gain and NOT in the main park area. Go past the road to the main gate on Rt 12 and down below the canyon. On the right side of the road is a pull out for the trail head and toilets. BE ADVISED: there is no water station here so bring your own.
Queens Garden/Navajo Trail/Rim Trail Sunset Point to Sunrise Point: LOVED this hike. RAther than go down the side of Navajo Loop that has Thor's hammer, which you will see at the start of the hike at Sunset Point stay to the right and go down into the canyon through an amazing slot canyon that has some massive pines somehow growing up through the canyon. At the bottom join the Queen's Garden Trail and take that to Sunrise point. The assent is a bit strenuous but just take a break and enjoy the view every now and again. You will enjoy the canyon and the accomplishment.
Notable sights: Inspiration Point and Fairyland Point. Also stop in the visitor center and check out the ranger talk schedules."

Take the Park Service Shuttle - hop on / hop off at 9 stops. Stay as long as you want at each, or skip a stop. Very limited parking and they keep cars moving, so if no parking sport, they make you move along. Shuttle is nice, friendly drivers, saves a LOT of hassle.

If you are planning to hike this park I would recommend starting at Bryce Point and hiking down towards Sunset Point. That way you don't have to hike uphill. I did the Navajo and Peekaboo Trail which were amazing. Navajo Trail is a must trail here, I would recommend that when going down the trail going left will make it easier to hike back up. The Peekaboo trail I would recommend that you go right where the ""v/trail"" starts and make it to at least the Wall of Windows. Watch out for horse dropping on Peekaboo/and the smell can be bad at times."

The views from the rim are nice, but are exquisite at sunset. You must be on the rim at sunset!! We did go down into the canyon for a 4 mile hike from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point during the daytime. Wall Street was jam packed with tourists. It actually looked like a human ant farm. Once we got past Wall Street though the crowds thinned out. The hike down into the canyon was quite easy and absolutely breath taking. However, what goes down must come up and coming up wasn't a piece of cake. It was REALLY hot and while the incline wasn't bad, it was a hard hike up (especially for my 12 year old son). We all had camelbacks, which is a 'must' in the heat! You can not overestimate how much water you need. Bring more than you think you'll need.
We really liked our hike (except for maybe my son) and we loved the views of the canyon at sunset. We also really enjoyed seeing several deer within the park."

The afternoon we arrived we hiked the Rim Trail trail from Bryce point to Sunset. This is an easy hike that allowed excellent views. We took our time and made it a leisurely hike and stopping frequently to enjoy the impressive rock formations.
We returned the following day and hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden Trail. I recommend it highly. My two teenagers were awed by the beauty. Hiking amongst the hoodoos versus seeing them from the rim is a must and worth the effort. We each took dozens of photos.
The trail is busy but wasn't crowded. Besides we spent so much time taking in the scenery that it never was an issue.
What surprised me most was the lack of rangers. My wife and I commented that we thought we would see more.
Bryce is such a great National Park. I highly recommend it. Wish we had more time to explore."

It doesn't matter if you are an avid hiker, a day hiker (like me) or not a hiker at all. We saw people in wheelchairs and with walkers at the canyon rim.
We did the Queens Garden/ Navajo Trail hike (liked Wall Street so much that we returned and did the Navajo Trail a second time), the Rim Trail from Bryce point to the lodge, Bristlecone Loop (takes you out to Yovimpa Point which is amazing) and the Mossy Cave Trail. The were all very easy except Queens Garden/Navajo Trail which has some wicked switchbacks. I really loved the area. The views are beautiful and change with the sun/clouds. We did not stay in the park, but rented a charming farmhouse in Tropic. I would love to see the area in the winter (with snow) as I'm sure it would be completely different, but wonderful!"

This is a park that is a feast visually. Easy to drive from overlook to overlook. Most of the path on the rim trail is paved. Lots of parking and facilities (restrooms, picnic tables, water bottle refill stations). We drove up from Zion as a day trip.
I would have loved to hike here and we had time. However, you're another 2,000-2,500 feet higher than at Zion and yes - the air is thinner. During our road trip we had snacks in the car that we purchased in Zion - pop chips to be exact. So the bag expanded so much that it was taut and we thought it would indeed burst and pop chips all over the car. So yeah - if you're not used to that altitude, it may take some time to get used it before you embark on a hike across desert at the bottom of a hot hoodoo canyon. That's my only regret - no hiking to the bottom and across, and I hear that it's splendid.
Take your refillable water bottle with you and a heavier coat. It was warm in Zion, but windy and cold up in Bryce (altitude change)."

What goes down, must come up. :0) We are in our middle 70s and have done a lot of beautiful hikes during our 12 years of RVing. This hike definitely looked more challenging (from the top). The well maintained trail, with lots of hairpin turns (helped with the steepness) made it easier than I thought. How does one describe what it is like, walking among slot canyons, arches and a bazillion amazing natural formations. Each one with it's only personality, allowing one to use their imagination. It is impossible to take a bad photo. I would allow at least 3 hours, use good walking shoes, walking stick and stay hydrated. Am having a hard time picking out just a few photos as we took lots.

Sure the main hoodoo ampitheatre here is unique and rather special, but away from there, the canyon is very nice but nothing to write home about. It lacks the kind of vistas that Canyonlands have (they have great hoodoos too) and it lacks the photogenic grandeur of Zion or Yosemite. We were rather underwhelmed to be honest.
The walk down into the canyon to the Queen's garden area is a great experience but it is quirky rather than awe inspiring. I am sure walks away from the main hoodoo area also have much of interest but if you are on a limited time trip there are several other places where more time can be better spent."

The hikes are excellent and at every turn you see sights that leave you speechless. You just marvel at nature's excellent design sense and creativity. The park has a good shuttle system and if visiting during peak season and peak hours, taking the shuttle is a great option to save you from the hassles of parking. Parking at each trail head and point is easier to find later afternoon or early morning. We did half the Peekaboo trail (2.7 miles) and combined it with the Navajo loop (0.6 miles. the other half was closed) thanks to a ranger's suggestion and it was awesome! We also walked from sunset point to inspiration point which is a great trail with fantastic views.We caught sunset at inspiration point (gorgeous) and stayed past midnight for the stars! Oooooh so pretty! The next morning we drove straight to Rainbow point (the end of the road) thanks to some great tips online and worked our way backwards to all the vista points. We did a 1 mile RT Bristlecone trail loop at Rainbow point and stopped at Black Birch Canyon, Ponderosa Canyon, Agua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point, Swamp canyon, Sunrise Point. We then hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail (1.8 mile RT) which was beautiful! On our way out of Bryce, we stopped at the Mossy Cave trail (0.8 mile RT). All in all, this park is something else! My dreams were full of hoodoos for several days!

We had no delays in entering BC upon arrival around 9 AM. A visit to the Visitor Center is always recommended.
Unlike Zion, BC allows for vehicular access to many stops though most ""vistas"" or ""overlooks"" require a bit of an uphill hike to truly appreciate. BC offers many wonders to behold and worth more than the 4 to 5 hours our itinerary allowed.
During the season BC offers NPS sponsored talks dealing with many areas of interest to the inquiring mind. We happened by chance upon a talk by a park volunteer delivered with the Canyon as a backdrop. To listen to him explain the geologic process's that formed the landscape we beheld made me wish I had paid closer attention in Geology class. Young kids were in attendance, even they were listening. good Q & A afterward as well. If we do this again I will check the BC website where talks and events are posted so as to better plan the trip.
If you want to see wildlife go to another park. There were several huge crows/ravens hanging out near the parking areas waiting for handouts but that was the extent of the critters we saw.
Upon our departure from BC we were faced with one of those choices any married couple faces many times along the road to, thus far, 35 years of marital bliss. Do I (she asks) trust the GPS taking us on the direct route to Torrey, N on US-89, or do I say yes once again, to him, and trust all will be well by taking the long way along the ""All-American Road""; the ""Scenic Byway"", Utah SR 12?
Next time....the Scenic Byway and a drive not to be missed......"

The hoodoos are just so weirdly beautiful! I don't know where else you can see them. The way the color changes during the day as the sun is bright, or when it sets makes it a different look throughout the day. Some good hikes here, with several fairly close to one another, so day-trippers would find it a good place to visit."

There are lots of great trails and also excellent viewpoints you can drive to or ride the free shuttle from Bryce City or the Visitor Center. I hiked from Inspiration Point to Sunrise Point, then down the Queen's Garden Trail and back up the Wall Street Trail. There was really some amazing scenery on that hike! There are some steep parts but you can easily stop and rest if needed. Overall, the park scenery is very unique!"

We took the shuttle the first day, just to get a sense of the park. The following two day, we drove the entire length of the park and stopped at all of the scenic turn offs. It is a magical place! We had a few dinners and lunch at the Lodge - the food was excellent. The park ranges from about 6000 feet to almost 10,000 feet above sea level, so you may notice the ""thinner"" oxygen. Their are all levels of hiking trails and they also offer horse rides into the canyon. So worth the visit."

We just recently took some friends from Mongolia. EVERY place you see or any place you hike to offers the most incredible, beautiful views. I often commented to my husband that it is so beautiful it almost doesn't look real! Bryce Point, to me was the most incredible view....reds, pinks and white. Absolutely gorgeous! We hiked the Wallstreet trail.... we were sandwiched between 2 tall red walls, dropping 700 feet in elevation continuing on along a trail meandering through beautiful red cliff faces and red rock Hoodoos. We continued onto the Navajo Loop loving every new rock formation around every bend in the trail. A must see!"

Our friend was blown away with wonder and imagination when he was here. We had visited many national parks and canyons and there was no place like Bryce Canyon. Hoodoos (odd-shaped pillars of rock left standing from the forces of erosion) could be found on every continent, but here is the largest collection of hoodoos in the world! Descriptions failed and photographs did not do justice either."

Gorgeous mid day, but the early and late evening light is so special. Get your butt out of bed and see the daylight come into the amphitheater.. We stayed at the Best Western Ruby's complex, short drive to Inspiration Point, Sunrise point, sunset point, you can't pick a bad spot for sunrise. Do not count on the bus getting you into the park for sunrise, it does not start soon enough. Saw people standing at the bus stops early in the morning and it was going to be a couple hour wait for them. Drive all the way into the park to see the all the lookouts. Don't stop until you get to Rainbow point, 18 miles into the park. Then do all the pullouts on the way back out, so you are not crossing traffic. Now, plan on a day of hikes down into the hoodoos, Navajo and Queens garden are fairly easy and get you down with the hoodoos. Or, do the 3 hour fantastic horseback ride which takes you on a full tour of the canyon. The ride on peek a boo loop was one of the most beautiful rides I have been on. Don't do a ride outside the canyon, book with Canyon Trail rides to take you actually into the main amphitheater. We had Trent as our trail leader and he was terrific. Trust your horse and hang on. The horses/mules were in great shape and well cared for."

You need to sign up in advance but only as early as a week. I called 6 days before and had no trouble getting seats. The bus is air conditioned. Our guide was April. She had grown up in the area and is currently a cattle rancher in a nearby ranch. Her local knowledge was fantastic. She added her own stories and personality to make the tour feel more like a field trip! It takes 3.5 hours and you make about 4 or 5 stops. Each stop is only a short distance to the viewpoint and several have rest rooms. This was the best way to see Bryce. We all learned so much and had a wonderful trip."

Would have been better but over half the park was off limits due to road construction. Still scenery was very nice and the hoodoos were the stars of the show. Lodge and cabins available for rent to visitors. Cannot comment on quality as we did not stay here. Also a park store where visitors can buy souvenirs, etc. Store was very hot, apparently no a/c. Other activities in the park include hiking and horse riding. (Again cannot comment on quality of these activities). Bryce Canyon City is located near Bryce Canyon. Motels, food, etc. are available and is very convenient to the Park. Several miles from the main park is a bike trail right near the road. Also stop at the forestry headquarters near the turnoff from the main highway. There is a statue of Smokey the Bear. Good for photos with kids of all ages. (I had to get one of myself and my wife with Smokey.) Plenty to do here. You can see the whole park in one day, but would not get to enjoy all of the park activities."

The views and rock formations are amazing. My favourite was Wall Street. This National Park should be on everyone's bucket list as it is a truly spectacular place to visit."

We allowed more time to spend on the hikes that go below the rim. We also hikes on the easy bristlecone trail on the south end of the park which we thought had the most amazing views of the park. We also did the east Mosey Cave hike which was worth the extra effort of locating the trailhead outside of the park.
We also found it was more enjoyable to start the visit in the late afternoon, stay for sunset, stay overnight in Bryce, and then continue in the park early the next morning."

We did one day trip to Bryce from Zion. That time was enough to see all vista points and did Navajo loop trail.
My favorite view was Bryce point and inspiration point.
Tip: since all views are on the left side, start from the last vista point and then visit in reverse direction so don't need to cross road all the time."
