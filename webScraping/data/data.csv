All three routes offer spectacular views. Little Cottonwood Canyon is an eight-mile drive that ends in the old mining town/now ski resort town of Alta. If the steep granite walls didn't clue you in, the heavily bunkered resort buildings and periodic gates and avalanche warning signs would tell you that this drive is not one to be taken lightly in the winter. But in the fall, the foliage is absolutely gorgeous, especially in contrast to the granite. If you want to get out and walk, there is Temple Quarry Trail at the mouth of the canyon. Just keep in mind that there are no dogs allowed anywhere in the canyon (to protect the watershed). Alta itself is a bit of a disappointment as a town, as there is really nothing there except the resort. But as a little getaway to nature that is just minutes away from Salt Lake City, it is definitely worth a visit."

Very much worth your time if you love the outdoors.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28965-d220092-r507212250-Little_Cottonwood_Canyon-Utah.html","Jul 2017 • Couples","On our last trip to Salt Lake, my wife and I had about an hour or so of free time, so we decided to take a drive up the canyon. The road ends at Alta ski resort, so you'll need to turn around and go back to where you came from. Other canyons we have seen actually connect to roads on the other side - such as the drive up to Park City, for example. However, this probably means there are fewer cars along your way.
The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. I'm sure it would be pretty dangerous during the winter months with snow and ice everywhere, but if you are here during the summer months, you have plenty of wonderful scenery to enjoy. Along the way, there are several places to stop and take pictures or just enjoy the view.
The drive up to the top of the road does not take very long - it's only about 9 miles or so from the base of the canyon to Alta. But it also means you can see the entire canyon quickly.
If you love the outdoors, you would love to make this drive."

Although mid-July may be a couple weeks before peak season, the hike up the path to the mountain lake was quite spectacular. It's the perfect place to escape the 90+ degree temps down in the City with a breezy mid-70's temperature to enjoy while climbing the trail. There is no shortage of wildflowers in all directions, as well as leftover snow pack in many places. The canyon in the winter is prime skiing area, so there are chairlift towers around, but not enough to diminish the enjoyment of the scenery. There are bathroom facilities by the main parking lot at the trail head. Parking can be a bit hard to find. The volunteers on the roadway will encourage you to park well below the trail and take a tram up to the final parking area, but we took the risk and were rewarded with a newly vacated spot. There are also a few turn-outs along the drive up that offer spaces for 3-5 cars, so it is possible to park short of the trail head and hike the road a ways. We noticed quite a number of couple with very young children in backpacks because the climb is only moderately demanding. Note, that the elevation in the canyon is over 9,000 above sea level, so if you are from a much lower altitude, you may possibly get a bit more winded than you might expect."

I used to live in Sandy, which is in the valley below the drive up the canyon. It's very easy to get there and it's not as crowded as Park City and some of the other scenic drives in Utah.
It's definitely my favorite drive in the fall. When the leaves are changing, it's an amazing drive. It's also got some nice hiking trails for the summer months. It's a nice break in the summer from the heat in the valley. The trees always smell amazing and there's usually a nice breeze.
I love this canyon and wish I could go back more often."

Glaciated, U-shaped canyon. Mountains rise 7,000 ft over Salt Lake valley floor. Tram ride at Snowbird is amongst the most scenic trams/gondolas in US, and new restaurant at top is an outstanding place to have a bit to eat, soak up sun and chew on God's scenery. Caution that if snowy, won't see much and road requires chains and/or 4WD with significant fine if you get stuck b/c you drove up with bad equipment (rent the right car at airport if winter). NO dogs allowed including in car (another min. $125.00 fine). Numerous excellent hikes in the canyon, but none are truly easy. Pretty much all are at least intermediate if not hard. 2 ski resorts, Alta, Snowbird are world class skiing, although Alta isn't world class hotels/amenities (people ski here, so this isn't peopled by boards of monied folks.)

The views are great, the wildflowers were gorgeous. We got to catch a deer grazing and of course all kinds of little critters and birds. Great views down the valley. Our time was short, so we didn't get a chance to spend more time here, they were running lifts up to one of the peaks and there are some restaurants open--but we needed to spend only about an hour of our time. It was totally worth it, though and highly recommended."

From the city limits of Sandy to the end of the trail above the ski resorts, the winding road takes you from pines and aspens, through fir and spruce, and up above the tree line. If you're there for the bloom of the spring wildflowers, the views are truly breathtaking.
The fauna can be spectacular as well. The canyon is home to many species of birds and fish as well as squirrels, pine martin, deer, and other Rocky Mountain creatures. This is also the one place where I can almost always spot a moose.
Take a day or just a two-hour drive. Take a picnic or just a bottle of water. Take your family or just a friend, but definitely take advantage of this spectacular natural wonder."

We picked a perfect day. It was sunny, warm, however lots of snow was still on the ground (there was an unexpected snow storm two days before). The paths were freshly groomed by snow grooming machines. The hike was very pleasant, and easy. Most ski lifts were opened, few skiers, a couple of show-shoers.
After climbing to one of the lifts, we sat on rocks to eat snacks and enjoy breath taking views. One complain - as a first time visitor - no trail maps, the official trail site does not specify which trails are not accessible until summer. We wanted actually to go to Cecret Lake, but learned from a local person, that it is truly a summer hike. However we both had a good time on whatever trail that was"

It’s a tough climb but I found plenty of places to stop and I did that quite a lot. My Garmin showed up to 13% gradient and on my not friendly hire bike gearing it was very tough. Good news there’s plenty places to stop, take a drink and take in the beautiful scenery.
You can get up over 8000 feet or 2500m and I was there in November. There was snow around and plenty on the high mountains and it’s cool towards the top of course, but I was warm enough for a short sleeve jersey. On the way down I put everything on!

Brighton has great deals for family skiing. Solitude has some expert only ski runs. They both have long skiing seasons as well.
But during the summer it is a great place to escape the heat and get away from the city. There are many trails, some of them for overnight camping.
There are a number of locations for camping and improved sites, as well as the hike in camping.There are group campsites as well.
Children will love walking around the lake up at the Brighton ski resort during the summer. They should be able to see some fish in the shallow lake.
And it is especially beautiful in the fall, when the vibrant autumn leaves or contrast to the evergreen trees.
It is very convenient as the mouth of the canyon is no more than 20 minutes from the heart of Salt Lake City."

The roads are very narrow in some locations and lots of curves in the road. Some steep drop offs may make you nervous or excited. Plenty of road side parks and trail heads to get off on and explore. The leaves were starting to change for the fall and were beautiful.
Not sure I would take kids under 8 years of age there unless they listen well and don't wander off.

The entrance follows the course of the creek,terrain elevation increases gradually . Then you enter an area with steep,dramatic rocky mountains that come down to the level of the road. It is breathtaking! There are turnoffs and a camp ground where photo moments are accessible. After navigating a series of switchbacks the landscape opens up to vistas of heavily forested mountains and you are driving toward two popular ski areas,Solitude and Brighton. Both have great skiing and numerous restaurants and shops at their base.
This canyon is popular and crowded year round.
Fishing,camping,shopping,hiking are also available.
If you visit Salt Lake City anytime of the year, this is a must trip. You will love it!

The trail heads don't have enough parking, forcing cars to line the sides of the narrow two lane road. I'm a home owner in the canyon and often see piles of broken glass at the trail heads from nasty thieves that wait for hikers to leave so they can do a smash and run with your valuables. In the summer, selfie-taking motorists litter the road side as LOUD Harley's rumble past in large SLOW moving groups. In the winter, especially on a powder day, better plan on making sure there is a place to park at the ski area before you spend 1.5 hours in a line of traffic so you don't get turned back. When departing BCC on a powder day or a holiday or some random day for no reason, it may take you up to 2 hours to get down the canyon.
Something must be done. This is heartbreaking. TAKE THE BUS! CARPOOL! GO TO COLORADO!"

Big Cottonwood Canyon is just minutes away from all the amenities of the city, but when you get there it is like getting away from it all. The hiking opportunities in the canyon are terrific. I especially enjoy Donut Falls for an easy walk or the Lake Mary Trail above Brighton for a little more exercise. There are also much more strenuous hikes for when I'm energetic. There are numerous mountain bike trails and rock climbing areas as well. I've enjoyed camping in the canyon or driving the dirt road over the top to go into Park City. In the winter, the snowsports in Big Cottonwood Canyon are exceptional. The famous ski resorts in Little Cottonwood Canyon - Alta and Snowbird - are wonderful, but the locals know that Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood Canyon are just as good, are more reasonably priced, and often not as crowded. There is also an excellent cross-country ski center and miles of back country options as well. Simply put, Big Cottonwood Canyon is an outdoor paradise."

But all of that and more is on the plate in Big Cottonwood Canyon in Utah. Located in the Wasatch Range 12 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, the 15-mile-long canyon provides hiking, biking, picnicking, rock climbing, camping and fishing in the summer. In the winter, its two ski resorts, Brighton and Solitude, are popular destinations for skiers and cross-country skiers, snowshoe hikers and snowboarders. For sight-seers and folks who enjoy fresh mountain air, the canyon is accessed by The Big Cottonwood Canyon Scenic Byway, which runs its length to Guardsman Pass at the top of the canyon, allowing travel to Park City in the summer months. Hiking to the canyon's mountain lakes is a popular activity, with many trails leading to lakes such as Mary, Martha and Katherine. The canyon's most popular hiking trail, 3.1 miles long and very strenuous, leads to Lakes Blanche, Florence and Lillian. The canyon also is a frequent destination for Utah Native Plant Society wildflower walks and for University of Utah botanical field trips. Storm Mountain is a popular picnic site and S-Curve Area is a favorite gathering place for rock climbers. A drive through the canyon with your car windows open is as refreshing as a dip in cold water."

I enjoy going up there and there are a good number of nooks on the wooden trail that surrounds the lake to allow you to fish in peace while others enjoy their hikes on a beautiful nature trail. Do remember that Silver lake is located at the Brighton ski resort and that means :Beware"" of elevation and temperature, even in the summertime.

But, over the past 8 years, it's gotten increasingly overrun. On the weekend, if you're not there crazy early, forget about it. Trailhead parking is mobbed. Even parking on the shoulder gets congested. They may have to consider making it a fee area. Sadly, it's getting loved to death. We used to come for weeks every summer, but we're moved a lot of our mountain time to Colorado to avoid the hordes. When we do come, we ride bikes up from the mouth of the canyon to Brighton and back down to Silverfork for breakfast. If we hike, we get the trailhead bright and early.

AVOID THE WEEKEND OR A HOLIDAY. I can't speak to a weekday, but I'm pretty sure that would be better. I don't think it could be worse.

It is a huge area and, depending on your desires can results in a leisurely stroll around Silver Lake, of present a more strenuous activity. Even if you decide not to get out of the car (no judgement) it is worth the journey to see the beauty that is the Rocky Mountains. For those of you who do choose to do some exploring, note the elevation can exceed 8000 feet, which means the air can be a bit thin. So take your time and enjoy the journey.
Some have said that it can be very crowded, which does not surprise me, given it is so near SLC. But if you can manage a trip during the week, you will have no problem finding the peace and solitude you seek. As I was there in late August, the wildflowers were already gone, but I can imagine their Spring beauty. Regardless, it was a wonderful afternoon of trails, lakes and fauna."

Just to name a few of some of the best hiking in the valley.
Then there is ""The Silver Fork Lodge"" for fine dining. And if you want a very quaint get away. Perfect for an event or wedding as well.
That doesn't even touch the dining at Solitude ... or the Frisbee golf course.
Or the mountain biking trails!
It's absolutely breathtaking.
And ... let's talk skiing. I love Brighton ... it's such a nicely groomed fun place. Solitude to me is for the real experience skiers.
To me - this canyon is great for all four seasons.

We were on East Coast time, so we were in the canyon before 6 AM, but it was still overwhelmingly crowded with runners, bicyclists, and hikers. We hiked Donut Falls without too many people that early, but there were tons of people coming up when we were coming down. Then we hiked some trails at Guardsmans Pass. Parking was crazy, but we didn’t see too many people on the trail to the peak. The views were stunning!!! The trail to the lake was very busy and there were a ton of dogs, but it was still peaceful. Overall, a wonderful visit!"

We purchased a little book at the local REI with has short and very useful descriptions of all the major hikes. We also have a topographic map in case we get off the trail.
Make sure that you are prepared for the hikes, the temperature can be pretty cool in the morning and in the evening, pack an extra layer. A bug spray is also recommended, some of the shady trails have mosquitoes because of the alpine lakes.
Keep in mind, this canyon is a water shed area, the city gets its water from he melting snow, and in an effort to keep the canyon clean, they do not let dogs in the canyon. If you want to hike with dogs, you need to go to Millcreek Canyon. Make sure that you check the leash laws, dogs can go off leash there every odd day only."

The last (estimate) parts of the hike consists of about 500 meters covered in loose rocks in all sizes. You won’t meet many others on this hike, but is a very rewarding and stunning view when you get to the top. We also saw a Moose a long the way - nice! See the pics attached.
Ps: don’t go this trip if you aren’t in shape. In particular the last parts of the trip is tough. Bring a lot of food and water. Water can also be refilled along the way. We spent about 7,5 hours on this hike."

This is not, however, a trail for strollers. The landscape and vistas from the Lake Solitude trail are beautiful and it is quiet.

It is what I call our little ""alps"" -- for the well-maintained paved canyon road takes you in just a few miles right up into the alpine vistas as well as secluded glades and mountain meadows. Numerous places to explore, especially when the wildflowers are in bloom in late spring and summer (blooms usually come on a little later due to altitude, melting snow-pack, and spring rains) and you can participate in wildflower tours of several areas near ski resorts. If you are a history buff, the Wasatch canyons including Big Cottonwood have mining history beside the skiing industry. It's rugged and serene and you get away from city rushing around. You can get used to the quick ride up to the mountains as they are so close; once there, though, it is a fresh discovery each trip, never quite the same, though familiar and attainable. Big Cottonwood is called ""big"" because it has the longest miles of road up the canyon compared to Little Cottonwood Canyon ""next door"" to the south. These are only two of the many canyons that feed the Great Salt Lake Valley, and were formed respectively by glaciers (Little Cottonwood, U-shaped canyon) and rivers/streams (Big Cottonwood, V-shaped canyon).

I strongly urge folks to do the drive. Estimate around 40 minutes one way drive from Salt Lake City with no stops in between. Of course, most likely folks will stop for photos or simply to take in the views and that will add some time.

The road is paved and adequate with only one lane in each direction. It is medium steep with lots of curves, but easy to drive at safe speeds. There are many places to pull off to enjoy a picnic breakfast,lunch or dinner with tables, fire pits. Hiking trails are well marked. There is a lake at the top of the canyon that has a boardwalk all the way around it. It's an easy walk for anyone. In the fall the colors are spectacular. There are a few restaurants along the canyon drive, but bringing your own food is the best way to enjoy a meal in natural beauty."

The canyon is absolutely stunning with a beautiful stream that follows the canyon floor. The rock formations are majestic and speak to amazing forces that formed the canyon long ago. We have only been during the winter time when snow can get quite deep further up the canyon. Compared to Little Cottonwood Canyon, home to Alta and Snowbird ski resorts, Big Cottonwood Canyon is far less crowded, thus the name Solitude. We love the Inn at Solitude where we stay for the slope-side accommodations and friendly staff. The mountain has something for every skier. Don't miss the first tracks skiing on Sunday and Monday for Inn guests as well as the rescue dog demonstration on Saturday afternoon."

It’s a beautiful meander in the spring, summer and fall, and a cross country dreamland in the winter on snow covered frozen ice. On the spring through fall hike, there are wildflowers, docks you can fish off, .and moose to photograph.
If you’d like a more rigorous trail that heads up and overlooksl the lake, take the transecting trail that heads upwards.
When you return to the parking lot, there are lavatories, a map and explanation of how the Mormon pioneers celebrated the 24th of July at the lake, and across the parking lot is a nice, woodsy shop with ice cream and other eatables, as well as great books on the flora and fauna of the region.
Of course if you still have energy, across the way is Brighton Ski Resort with many more lakes and trails."

We spend some time strolling around Silver Lake (sad to say, the visitor center was not open) and then decided to hike up to Lake Mary.
For those not in the know, there is parking for the Lake Mary hike right near the Brighton Ski Lift.
The hike was FABULOUS. It's not a long distance from trailhead to lake, but it is rather vertical. The lake itself is an alpine gem, with snow covered mountains in the back and wonderful views.
I should warn others that there was already ice on the trail in mid-October, some of it hidden by dirt. But if you watch your step (particularly on the way down), you'll find this a truly memorable hike!"

Right now (October) is the best time to view fall foliage. It is also not too late for a good hike--try Dog Lake up Butler's Fork and down Mill D north fork for a great half-day moderately strenuous one. Or Donut Falls for an easy hour. Or Cecret Lake for moderate.
July is best for wildflowers.
Of course, skiing in the winter!
Go most of the way up and then over Guardsman Pass into charming Midway and get some ice cream & cheese at Heber Valley Artisan Cheeses."

It is one of my favorite places on Earth. Silver Lake to Lake Solitude is a perfect hike for me alone or with children. Donut Falls is also a mild hike. Lake Mary has to be one of the most beautiful lakes on this planet -- a deep blue that took some dedicated workers to build. You can still find the building implements left at the site. There's Dog Lake, Lake Blanche, and the Albion Trail if you want to cross over into Little Cottonwood Canyon.

The drive itself is beautiful, with amazing rock formations the first few miles, followed by wildflowers, waterfalls, and green meadows. There are many places along the way to pull over for better views and to get some great photos. There are some amazing hiking trails and some nice spots to simply sit, relax, and take in nature. The drive takes you to Solitude Resort, then to Brighton Resort, about two miles further up the road, where the canyon ends. During the summer, I highly recommend taking the drive up Guardsman's Pass, which is an incredibly scenic drive that takes you up to the backside of Jupiter Bowl at Park City, then down into the Deer Valley Resort area. At the top of the pass, there's a small dirt parking lot, where you can park and spend some time taking in the amazing views. If you want to stand at the top of Jupiter Bowl and look back over Park City, there is a small dirt road that curves up the hill across the street. It's about a 1/4 mile uphill walk, but it's relatively easy and you'll be rewarded with some terrific views.
If you're short on time, the drive up and back through Big Cottonwood Canyon will take less than two hours round trip from downtown SLC, assuming no stops along the way. If you have several hours, it's well worth making the Guardsman's Pass drive, then exploring Deer Valley and Park City before returning to SLC via I-80."

The trail was crowded, as there were many people who had the same great idea, but it was still a lovely jaunt into wildflowers, meadows, and over a few rocks. There was plenty of wildlife to see despite the humans. The falls are pretty, but a little underwhelming, but in this case, it's about the journey as much as it is about the destination."

Not really for the average climber, the routes are way too hard, and the gradings seem to be off by about 2 grades compared to elsewhere (a 5.7 feels like a 5.9). As the median grade here is about a 5.11b, you will get crowded out in the weekends as there aren't relatively that many easier climbs here.
The climbs are on quartzite, a type of metamorphasised sandstone, which normally is quite strong (see the Arapiles in Australia). However this place seemed to have a lot of loose rock, and it was hard to place nuts/stoppers. So you need quite a big rack of cams to climb here (20?). Having said that, the quartzite here is an excellent challenge for those who want to be a truly international climber, but seems to be stuck on granite which dominates 70% of USA crags. It can have a slippery surface, and it will take a while to read where the holds are!
The routes are typically 1-3 pitches long so not a big day out/adventure. And you need to start early so you don't get caught by summer afternoon thunderstorms.
Good luck :)"

In the summer, they are stunning scenic drives that provide access to many hiking trails. In my opinion Big Cottonwood Canyon is the more dramatic of the two, and if you're only going to explore one of them, I say choose this one. Not only is the scenery awe-inspiring, but the drive ends in a loop through the tiny but picturesque ski resort town of Brighton. In Brighton, you can stop at the cafe and relax and enjoy the view of the mountain amphitheater that surrounds the town. Important note: there are no dogs allowed in the canyon at all (for protection of the watershed)."

The vistas along this route are fantastic, and there are several trailheads along the way if you have time for a hike. In one spot, we counted 20 hawks flying over a meadow and enjoying the mountain breeze - gliding up, diving at high speed and racing by us - that was a treat. I will use this as a slower but much more beautiful route to/from Park City (season permitting - parts of this route are closed during snow season)."

HOWEVER, and this is a big drawback, canines aren't allowed up there because it is a watershed and the waste presents a problem. Now, I am arguably one of the biggest dog lovers on Earth, so when I want to take my Australian Kelpie hiking, I avoid this canyon and the potentially hundreds of dollars in fines I might face if caught with Lyla up there. So, instead I tend to go to nearby Millcreek Canyon. I LOVE the atmosphere and terrain at Solitude Resort and the group of characters, called the FOGS (check for the group's Facebook Page) who congregate and tailgate there mostly on Sundays and Wednesdays. It has changed a bit since it was bought by Deer Valley Resort in 2015. But it's still got the least crowded lines and coolest patrons and staff in my opinion. So if you want to hike or camp there, leave Fido at home (bummer, I spend as much time with my dog as I can, and aside from skiing up there I don't go very often). Oh, and the nordic skiing is excellent there too and snowshoeing."

In addition, the canyon has great hiking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. One of my favorite hikes is to park near The Pines and hike to Donut Falls. It is an easy hike at any time of the year. In the winter, the fall comes down the mountain under the snow at the end of the roughly 2.0 mile hike through the woods (on marked trails). Visitors climb up a somewhat steep, but short canyon wall and then slide down into a cave that opens into a large cavern. The waterfall flows through a hole in the ceiling. Rimmed in ice, it is absolutely stunning. To get down from the cave, most people sit down and slide on their ski pants or even haul up sleds and use them. This is a very popular spot for families. The views are great in winter and summer."

The ski resorts are closed but yet there was just enough snow on Monday, June 12 to take some good photos and feel the 35+ wind in your face.
The total distance was about 47 miles and took 2 hours including stops to take photos. I am planning to do once more in July to see how the peaks look without the snow this time.

We went on a week day evening last month, and had a fantastic time.
It has been an odd spring this year, with lots of snow and lower temperatures, and then heating up fairly quickly. As a result, the stream is running very high. We stopped just below Storm Mountain and did some exploring, and it was amazing to see the power and beauty of the river cascading down the canyon. Further up, by the ""S-curve"" we got out to see the waterfalls, but didn't have time to hike to Lake Blanche (one of our favorites) this trip. We continued up the canyon to Brighton and saw a moose by Silver Lake, and were planning on going up over Guardsman Pass to Park City, but it was still closed off and had several feet of snow on the road. Can't wait until a little more melts so we can get through. Will definitely be back through the summer and fall to hike Lake Catherine, Mary and Martha as they are a great couple of hour hike."

It is also home to Brighton and Solitude Ski Resorts. Known as BCC to the locals it has a rich Mining History as well. Bus Service is available during Ski Season and Lodging is very limited.
For those who are driving from downtown Salt Lake City, it is about 16 miles to the mouth of the Canyon; it is another 16 miles to Brighton. About 13 miles up, you will approach a Cabin Community where lunch and dinner is available at the Silver Fork Lodge. A few miles further, you will see the main entrance to Solitude Ski Resort. Further on, you will see a village of private condominiums.
As you pass the Fire Station, you will be entering another Cabin Community, Brighton. On Brighton Loop Road, you will first see the Solitude Nordic Center. Once the snow melts, there is a popular boardwalk around Silver Lake also accessed at the Center. If you continue on the Loop, you will see Brighton Ski Resort. In the summer, there are several lakes that make for great destinations for hikers. Lake Mary tends to be the better choice for families. Mt. Wolverine and Sunset Peak are reserved for the more ambitious.
As you begin your descent down the Canyon, there is one additional road worth a look, Guardsman's Pass. It is closed for winter but is usually accessible Memorial Day through Labor Day. At the pass you can look into the Heber Valley and if you choose proceed over the pass; use caution as the grade is steep and although rare, some vehicles have driven over the side. This route is quite scenic and does take some time, but eventually you'll reach Deer Valley and Park City (stay left), or Midway and Heber (stay right).
If you continue back down BCC, take note that Mining for Silver and Gold was quite active during the late 1800's; a good eye will be able to spot some of the mine entrances. While many of these entrances are closed or collapsed, it is not advised to venture inside as there is the potential risk of injury and death. If hiking, you will often find remnants, such as tailings, structures and equipment. One other historic structure of interest is the Utah Power Stairs Plant, which is still in use to date.
While skiing is the rave during the winter, Hiking is the bomb during the summer. Popular hikes include, Doughnut Falls, Dog Lake and Lake Blanche, where you will gaze at Sundial Peak. Aside from Delicate Arch, Moab... Sundial Peak is the second most featured photograph for the State of Utah. Due to its popularity, this trail can be quite crowded and parking hard to find if you get a late start to your day. Rock Climbing on quartzite slabs is also quite popular in the Storm Mountain area.
Whether you are a Powder Hound in the winter or a Rock Hound in the summer, Adventure Awaits you in Big Cottonwood Canyon, where there is something for everyone. From a fantasy of fall colored leaves in September to the cold smoke powder in January, you won’t be disappointed. In July, you may be fortunate to see an array of wildflowers about the meadows; beware of Moose, they can be very aggressive. And if you are really adventurous, consider Mt. Superior along the Cottonwood Ridge or the Broad Fork Twins, breathtaking summits that exceed 11,000 feet in elevation.
There is more than meets the eye, so plan ahead. There are numerous publications describing the hiking routes and official websites for both resorts. The Canyon is well patrolled, so watch your speed and passing zones; there is also a volunteer Search and Rescue Team. Please Stay Safe and Enjoy Responsibly!!!"

The top places to visit include:
1) Silver Lake - This is lake at the base of Brighton Ski Resort. It the summer it is stocked with Trout and is great for fishing. I fish from the shore using Jake's spinner's and always catch fish. The lake is shallow and tends to get lots of growth as the Summer get's later. You can bring a float tube, canoe or small boat and fish from the middle. There is a mile trail walking around the lake that is beautiful and very easy (my 78 year old mother enjoyed this walk).
2) Spruces Campground - This is located ~ 2/3 up the canyon. It is a Federal Camp Ground and books up early, however they have campsites that can be reserved only by walk up so even if the website says it's full if you go early in the morning you can almost always get a campsite. These campsites are well taken care of with access to bathrooms and some of hookups. It is a great campground with full shade and very mature trees.
3) Guardsman Pass - This is located at the top of Big Cottonwood canyon. Take the turnoff just before Brighton Ski Resort. This road takes you to the top of the mountain and down into Park City or down into Midway/Heber. This is a gorgeous drive in the fall. On Holidays it gets very crowded and there is much room on the road and people park on the side and there are cars coming up and going down. Just be patient and you'll be fine (or go on a weekday and there won't be any traffic).
4) Solitude Disc Golfing - Solitude has a great disc golf course. You can ride the lift or just hike (I've always hiked and it's a good little hike). The holes are well marked. Be careful to keep an eye on your discs as they can be lost in the woods and grass very easily. You'll see moose and all kinds of birds on this course. Excellent!
5) At the base of Solitude there is a little Pizza Place that serves the best pizza! I only get it when we are camping or playing disc golf because it's quite the drive to the top of the mountain...but the pizza is well worth it.
There are lots of other hikes up Big Cottonwood Canyon and Storm Mountain is a great place for a picnic.
Big Cottonwood Canyon is the Canyon to play in for SLC."

Before I made my way I checked the road conditions and it was open so assumed the trail was open also. When arriving at Silver Lake there was still snow cover for which I wasn't equipped to hike upon. Oh, well. This was a 8 May visit and signs along the canyon road indicate that snow can be an issue up to mid-May.
I do recommend this place but in early May try to find out about remaining snow cover and don't go on a Sunday afternoon as most of the parking at the various trail heads, etc. fill up quick."

In late spring to early fall, the hiking and mountain biking trails are fantastic. Some of my favorites include Brighton Lakes, Hidden Falls, Donut Falls, and Willow Heights.
In summer, you can also climb a number of mountain peaks. Sunset Peak and Clayton Peak are both fun summits and don't require a lot of experience to climb."

This canyon is mostly water eroded, V-shaped sedimentary rock and not glaciated other than the upper stretches of it (in contrast with Little Cottonwood which is starkly different with U-shape from both glaciation and metamorphic rock). Both of the canyons are great scenic drives. Know the kind way to drive in the West is to pull off if blocking up traffic, as you can then soak in the scenery (makes it more enjoyable for all). 2 of the main ski resorts are in this canyon (Solitude, Brighton). There are multiple hikes ranging from easy to hard. There are easy hikes with minimal elevation gain. Realize hard/strenuous means not for younger kids, or low or average shape folks. BCC is becoming progressively more busy over the decades and now most popular hiking trails have no parking by about 0900-1000. There are only a few restaurants in the canyon, but they are good ones."

This is my first time hiking in the winter. The scenery was great. Even though couple sections of trail were very steep, I really enjoyed.

Lake Mary, easy hike go there.
Fall; colors galore; go drive this canyon for beautiful colors. So many shades of green, brown, orange, red!
Winter; snow show, skim, snowboard, ski. Brighton is the local resort, understand its a place with chalets and some rooms, but it is not snowbird or park city or solitude. This is where locals come to rip, bbq and drink. It's becoming a little more.strict but is still the spot for good times if you can meet some dope locals. Solitude has places to stay for sure, they have a lot of rooms and cabins for any size of party.
I can tell you more if you need more specifics! The above is just a brief seasonal review. Photo below is me at the top of brighton close to pioneer ridge in winter and summer!

When you drive on Cottonwood road, it will split at 7- eleven, Big Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood. The sign clearly marked for which way. If you are going to Big Cottonwood Canyon you will make a left turn on Cottonwood Road. If you are going to Little Cottonwood Canyon you will go straight.
As you drove along the Big Cotton, there are many places you can stop and hike. Our purpose was to go through Guardsman's Pass and into Park City. Unfortunately, Guardsman's Pass was closed for the season, so we make a U turn back down.
If your goal is Guardsman's Pass, as soon as you pass Silver Lodge Place, you will need to make a left turn up the hill and onto Guardsman's Pass. There will be sign for Guardsman's Pass."

It look us about 2 hours round trip with a little time at the top too. The surroundings for the hike were great! The lake at the top is nice, as long as you don't look at the cement reservoir wall. We heard that there is also a possibility of moose sightings on this trail, but didn't see any on our hike.

Hiking takes over after the snow is gone - with multiple trails for the beginner to the advanced and beautiful views. Big Cottonwood is home to Moose and spotting a Moose midday at Silver Lake is a really good bet. Silver Lake is handicapped accessible and beautiful"

A blend of private and public land holdings, it has generally resisted excessive development, although the ski resorts have been busy in their footprint acreage. Beautiful colors in the fall contribute to wonderland hikes...as do the late spring wild flowers. In the winter, the crowds tend to be a little more manageable. And summer offers a great time to beat the heat of the Sakt Lake Valley. Lots of bikers and hikers, so be careful on your drive up,the twisting (but well maintained) road. In the summer and fall, you can take the option to cross the ridge and drop into the Park City area...beautiful in color season."

It is one the most scenic drives in Utah. Each time we have guests from out of town in the summer time we take them up over the pass. The pass is closed in winter.
If you are visiting from out of town, head up, enjoy the mountains then drive over to Park City for dinner.
In summer, there are several hiking trailheads and many places to stop and get out and enjoy the mountains up Big Cottonwood. Stop and play with the kids or bring your camping gear and make it a weekend (or plan ahead and rent a cabin).
So much better than staying in Salt Lake.
In winter, the snow that piles up in the Cottonwood Canyons is some of the best, lightest, fluffiest, driest, amazingly fun stuff anywhere. If you don't know how to ski powder, take a lesson. It's like dancing through clouds."

You can get here from Salt Lake City via Route 190 (Big Cottonwood Canyon Road) or from Park City via Guardsman Pass.
In Brighton, you can find parking in the Silver Lake Information Center or across the street by the general store. There are many lakes and trails depending on your fitness level and desire.
Silver Lake has a 0.7 mile flat, boardwalk like trail - the easiest one of them all and is absolutely beautiful. We also took the trail to Twin Lakes (a reservoir about 1.25 miles away but over 730 feet upwards - so the distance is deceivingly long. It is a bit challenging considering the high altitude (almost 9000 feet above the sea level). It took us a good 1.5-2 hours for the round trip including a nice stop at the lakes. The Twin Lakes did not have much to look at besides a dam, but the hiking was a great exercise and the view from the top was breathtaking. You can see the entire Brighton area, with Guardsman Pass road in the distance. I wish we had more time to explorer more trails and that we had brought more water with us (we thought we would be back in 30 min for the so-called 1.25 mile trail.
I would highly recommend visiting the Brighton area if you are in SLC but please use the Route 190 to get here, because the Guardsman Pass road is not for the faint-hearted."

June is too early, things are dead and snow still melting. July-Sept is pretty. The drive is fairly scenic and enjoyable. Some nice hikes. But I'm surprised this is the #2 in TripAdvisors Things to Do in Salt Lake City. That's just not right at all. What a screwy ranking system. There are more iconic things to do in town than a trip to these mountains, especially if you have ever seen mountains in your life. If you haven't, then sure they're impressive. But the Rockies have many many places as good or better. Try something that is actually unique to Salt Lake City. It's the #2 ranking that just shocks me and caused me to write a review. If you have already seen everything else in the city and call that #1, then sure this could be #2.
Temple Square is iconic and unique, and 35 acres (Church Office Building observation deck, Tabernacle organ recital, Family History Library, gardens and fountains, Conference Center auditorium and rooftop garden, etc.) the State Capitol, This is the Place village and Pony Express monument....these ought to be ranked higher than a trip to the mountains. Big Cottonwood is nice but it's not some iconic range like the Tetons or some national park. C'mon. Screwy ranking system here."

We especially like the Brighton area, where they have several places for hiking, biking, fishing and just a great place for food and fun.Last weekend we came within 10 ' of two bull moose ahead of us on the trail. Majestic! You can also drive to the top of the summit (Guardsman Way) and go down the other side heading to either Park City or Heber. Brighton also has lodging at the resort, A little rustic, but so what you're in the mountains right! Skiing in the winter is great with snowboarding allowed and some varied kinds of trails.

I started this hike from the Big Cottonwood Canyon side at the Butler Fork trailhead which is exactly 8.2 miles from taking the left from Rte 210 onto Rte 190, on the left side.
The trail is very long. About 8 miles each way. Hiking to Dog Lake and then into the Olympus Wilderness from there. Do not go and take the Big or Little Water trail from Dog Lake. You can take the option of going left and forgoing the Dog Lake destination at the sign that says bear left for Mill A Basin and that takes you towards the Knob and mountain. The trail from the basin trail for the knob and or Mountain from Butler Fork and here is non descript. You'll have to make your own path up possibly until you get to the peak. The top is around 10,500'.
After quite albeit of time out there and a great challenging climb, with some rock scramble to Gobblers Knob, the return back down to join up with the Mills A Basin trail.
I ended up taking the ridge and then again down a dirt steep slope. After a full day of almost 5 hours hiking, the down return was quite challenging this route.
A beautiful hike. You definitely need to be in reasonable shape to do the Knob. Going to the mountain would definitely require more time or a dedicated trip and opt out of the Knob. The Goblers Knob in my own opinion is still a great destination."

Lake Blanche was more challenging -- took me 2.5 hours up and 1.5 hours down. Lake Mary was about 2 hours -- 1.2 hours up and 45 minutes down. You need to be in good physical shape to do Lake Blanche. But the good thing is that most of the Lake Blanche trail is in the shade, through the woods full of Aspen trees. One thing to note: 3/4 of the way up on the trail, it seemed to end at a big boulder field. There was no way to climb the bounders to the peak. I almost turned around and went back. Fortunately, my curiosity got better of me and I climbed the bounder field. 20 feet up, I saw a side trail that continued to the peak. So don't get discouraged by the boulder field -- just climb up and turn the corner.
Lake Mary trail didn't have much shade, but it's a lot shorter. For an average person who only has 2 or 3 hours, then Lake Mary would be a good choice.
Both had beautiful views at the end, with the lakes and mountains. If you are in SLC area and are an outdoor enthusiast, you definitely should make a trip to Big Cottonwood Canyon."

Plenty of trails to hike, there are several spots that get a lot of rock climbers, you can find great eats at the Silver Fork lodge and cafe, and of course there's the ski resorts of Brighton and Solitude. In Summer months, you can travel all the way up over the top of Guardsman Pass and then either pop over and drop down into Park City, or down into the Heber Valley. The turn backside of Guardsman was ""paved"" a season or two ago, with (I believe) reclaimed ground asphalt, so while it's not a dirt road now, it's still a bit rough. Guardsman Pass is closed in the Winter, but in the Summer, the top of the pass offers great views over the Heber Valley and surrounding mountains. Be aware though that a ton of people start their hiking and mountain biking day at the top of Guardsman, so summer weekends the parking and congestion there can get pretty crazy.
Keep an eye out in the Canyon for Moose, it's not unusual to see a couple hanging out around the Beaver Ponds. Make sure you stop to read about the ""Blind Miner"" that worked his claim in the Canyon. And with the popularity of drone photography, the ""S Curves"" are becoming a much ""drone photographed"" area. The S curves are also the parking area for several trailheads, so as with the top, parking here can get pretty busy."

It is an easy drive from Salt Lake off 215 with beautiful picnic areas, hiking trails, and even caves. Silver Lake is not only beautiful but easily manageable even with young children. A boardwalk circles the lake, and signs provide interesting information. Park rangers were friendly and knowledgeable and added to the visit. While moose are in the area, we didn't see any during our visit. We did see a beaver dam, ducks, and beautiful flowers. It was 103 in the city but a cool 63 in the canyon.

Big Cottonwood is one of my favorite Canyons to ride and go play in. The run up there is a sweet ride and posses scenic overkill at every turn. You can stop in at Solitude and snoop around. There are great opportunities to mountain bike or disc golf or hike till your legs give out. There are events at Solitude like the Sunday - 8/7/2016 Taste of the Wasatch. Check Solitudes website. If you go to the top at Brighton there is Silver Lake to see with a great Eco path around the lake to take a short hike around. There are other trails off the main one if you wish to hike up further to other mountain lakes to fish and enjoy. You may see Moose up there and some Japanese tourists frantically taking pictures of Moose foraging. I have seen bull and cow moose up there. Keep your distance and don't try to pet them or feed them. Just take pictures and enjoy them ... at a distance. I fired up my bike with Bullwinkle about 150 yards away and that got his attention as his head popped up with that huge rack to see if I was a threat. Their eyesight isn't all that good but he can smell real well. I dropped it into gear and made way for the exit.
Go up, cool off, have fun and enjoy the squirrels and chipmunks also(bring nuts and sunflower seed)."

The more adventurous can also take a hiking trail up the mountain. We have often spotted Moose and deer right around the lake. This is a fabulous place to snap family photos."

Whether you simply want a scenic drive or are looking for more adventurous outdoor activities, you'll find it here. Just 20 minutes from downtown SLC, you'll feel much further away once you enter the canyon. The road up the canyon is about 15 miles long, taking you past sheer cliffs, soaring peaks, and amazing rock formations. There are several spots along the way for hiking, viewing, and photo-taking. At the end of the canyon sit Solitude and Brighton ski areas, both of which offer outstanding skiing at a much lower price and with far fewer crowds than the Park City ski areas. In the summer, fall and spring, you can drive the Guardsman Pass road up and over the mountain to Deer Valley and Park City. The drive takes about 20-30 minutes and provides some incredible views, especially as you cross over the pass. At the pass, there is a small dirt parking area, where you can park your car and go for a hike. From there, you can hike up the backside of Jupiter Bowl and have a beautiful view of the Park City ski area, looking down through Thaynes Canyon."

You can pack a picnic and take an easy casual walk on a path that circles the pond and goes through the trees and around the park. There are places your kids can explore, go fishing or just look at the ducks. It's also a beautiful place to take fall pictures.

A 20 minute drive up the canyon ends at the little town of Brighton. In winter a great little ski resort. Year round a greast place to look for Moose. Early morning hikes it is almost a sure thing to come upon a family of moose. Excellent photo opportunities but do not get too close when you see females with their young. They do get mean. Always keep a tree between you and the moose. Walking around the boardwalk at Silver Lake is a great hike. Do look on both sides of the road during the drive up and down the canyon for all the other fauna. A side trip up Gardsman pass will lead you into Park City or Heber Valley if you want to make a day trip."

There is sometimes a charge for Silver lake in the winter time because of snowshoeing and cross country skiing. $5/person. Lake is FREE the other months."

If you are looking for hiking, I'd recommend reviewing the types of terrain and level of difficulty of the trails ahead of time so you can select the trail that is right for you. If you just want to take in some scenery, this is a beautiful drive with several places to pull off and appreciate the beauty. Parts of the drive can be very curvy and tight and there are some steep inclines, so if you are afraid of heights or if you are a nervous driver, this might be a bit of a challenge. It seemed like folks drove carefully and were respectful of those who needed to drive a bit slower.

The trail was rocky in places and unfortunately I wasn't wearing appropriate footwear or I would have continued further.

It was not for the faint of heart because you didn't want to look over the edge of the goad even as a passenger . But it was fun and a cool adventure!"

The colors are so beautiful when the leaves change. It curves and winds up the mountain until you reach the top, following the stream. There's a chance you may spot a deer or moose. You can stop at Solitude ski resort and experience their many activities or go to the end of the road to the Brighton ski resort and hike to one of several mountain lakes. Just a note of caution: the road is narrow and you need to watch for the many cyclists and runners that use it."

I would agree, however, that it's maybe the number 1 outdoor attraction--at least, if scenic grandeur, skiing, or hiking is what you're looking for. But there are numerous downtown attractions that are more unique to the area, closer to the airport, more easily visited, etc. And Millcreek Canyon, which is much closer to downtown SLC, is in some ways more beautiful than Big Cottonwood (it has more foliage and more spectacular colors in the fall, but is not as breathtaking and rugged).
Big Cottonwood Canyon is most easily accessed off I-215 (exit 6) onto E 6200 South (Hwy 190). Travel south on 190 about 2 miles to the canyon road and turn left (east).
The canyon is a major access road during the winter for two of Utah's biggest ski resorts--Brighton and Solitude. During the fair-weather months the canyon is a spectacular drive (especially for fall colors) or a jumping-off place for numerous hiking and biking trails. Here are a few.
First, 4.5 miles up the canyon the Mill B South interpretive trail (.5 miles long, one-way, which is paved, so great for kids and wheelchairs), and the Lake Blanche trail, which starts from the Miil B trailhead just before the falls and continues for almost three miles past glacier-scarred boulders up the fork to a stunning alpine lake. Across the S-curve and up the road a few hundred feet from Mill B South trailhead is the Hidden Falls trail and the Mill B North Fork trail, which offers great overlooks of the canyon. Both trails are relatively steep and relentlessly uphill.
Second, about 8.5 miles up the canyon is the Doughnut Falls trail, named for a waterfall that flows through the hole in a rock. Take the Cardiff Fork (Mill D South Fork) turnoff, then drive 1 1/4 miles to a parking area. An old mining road takes you 3/4 mile to Doughnut Falls, and the Cardiff mine in 2 1/2 miles.
At the top of the canyon are the Brighton and Alta ski resorts, a small A-frame store, and on the west side of the Brighton loop road, Silver Lake. The latter offers a nature center, a boardwalk and interpretive trail around the lake, fishing, and connecting trails to Lake Solitude and beyond. But the real treat is the network of trails and alpine lakes (Lake Mary, Martha and Catherine are all simply breathtaking) on the east side of the loop road, above the Alta parking area. Expect to see deer, moose, beautiful wildflowers, and some of the most gorgeous scenery you'll see anywhere in the world short of the Swiss Alps."

Here is how to do it in style. I recommend first stopping at Porcupine Grill for breakfast. Then check out the trails at Storm Mountain. I would also explore Donut Falls. Be careful though. The desire to scramble up the side of the falls has led to many injuries and falls. Some have been fatal. It is on private property and I am uncertain about the rules of access now. It used to be no probem to park and hike. Check out Silver Lake by walking around the lake via the boardwalks, and then if weather permits, drive over Guardsman Pass to Park City."

Don't rush the drive and get out often to enjoy the mountain air and the sounds of life you don't hear in the city. Take lots of pictures but look with your eyes more than you look through the camera lens. When the day is over mark a place on the calendar to set a point in time to revisit this scenic symphony of wonder.
The Good: When you are out in nature enjoy the moment
The Bad: After coming back to the city, missing the quite of the mountains
The Ugly: some people don't know how to drive slow and miss everything.

I had to laugh a little at the review which said there was no canyon.......??? It's 15 miles long, and at the top are two fantastic ski resorts: Brighton and Solitude. There's definitely a canyon! The road takes you from the valley floor level (about 4800 feet) to the ski bases, which are about 9,000 feet. From there, you can hike (or X-country ski or snowshoe) up higher if you want. The canyon has a number of excellent hiking trails to explore. I recommend stopping at REI or Kirkham's if you're not familiar with the area and pick up a hiking guidebook and some tips and suggestions from the local outdoor enthusiasts who work at either of those stores. Big Cottonwood is a great getaway from the summer heat, and you can grab a good meal at the Silver Fork Lodge on the way up or down (it's 1 mile or 2 from the top) or a burger at the Brighton Village Store."

Lined by a creek, which is one of the watershed areas for the valley, trees along the mountainsides if not interrupted by the rugged, rocky, cliffs, it is a sight to behold for anyone that drives through this wilderness area easily accessible even by the urbane.
Brighton, the locals favorite and Solitude, the place to get away from the crowd, are probably two of the best ski resorts in the US. These get among the best powder and of the deepest snow in these areas. The road that dead ends in winter at Brighton and goes over the Guardsman Pass over to Park City in summer with an unpaved (but, easy to drive) link, is well maintained throughout the year.
The 15-mile long canyon whose mouth is 2 minutes away from a freeway (I-215 belt route) is punctuated by picnic areas, camping sites, hiking trails, fishing area and rock climbing spots. Yet, it is not as crowded as much lesser nature's beauty out towards the coastal regions. The only time you will see a lot of traffic is during and right after closing of the ski area for the day in winter (weekends). The average summer driving time, one-way, is less than 30 minutes.
Canyons remain about 10-20 degree F cooler than the valley and often remains above the inversion effects that is seen in the valley.
Expect no public transportation in the summer, but the local public transportation, UTA, plies promptly in winter, carrying skiers/boarders up and down the canyon.
Water and restrooms are available at some picnic and camping areas. Restaurant and basic facilities at the Brighton and Solitude ski area (more extensively in winter). There is one good restaurant (Silver Fork) about 80% of the way up the canyon. Ski areas are at about the far end of the Canyon."

We found it and after driving around in the gravel parking lot for a bit we found a place to park. Very popular in summer. Crowded. This is a 1 mile RT hike up a gravel and rocky trail. Not paved. Easy to moderate difficulty. Saw many children hiking. Older folks may have a problem. Falls were pretty but not fantastic. Had to hike up the rocky river a bit to get to the falls.

There are many places to pull off the road and take in the scenery, which I recommend you do frequently: the air has such an earthy perfume, and the view will not disappoint you. Be sure to take along a camera, a comfortable pair of shoes, and a warm sweater for the high altitude (just in case). Above all else, enjoy it. I hope you love this place as much as I did."

Of course, her experience of mountains was the rolling hills of Tennessee. When I actually took her on a drive in to the canyon, basically her mouth just hung open the entire time. I know there are more majestic mountains in the country and in the world but to have them so accessible every season of the year and to be able to get out of the car and take a hike of every endurance level you would choose, is something.
My husband and I went to Silver Lake this past weekend. Even as many times as I have been there, it's still quite stunning and beautiful. Some of my favorite hikes are Mill B South, of course, the simple stroll around Silver Lake, Spruces, Tanners Flat, Lake Blanche, Gobbler's knob (This can be accessed by both Millcreek and Big Cottonwood canyons) Keep in mind that not all trails are wheelchair accessible but Silver Lake has portions that would be."

The spot from where you enter the canyons till the end of road is just so scenic. There is a spring that flows beside you, downstream and has got cut outs at places where you can stop to smell the grass and see the beauty of running water. Pack a meal and you can just drive down here, and eat it in all the sylvan surroundings. as you climb up the mountain, you will feel the air go colder, and every mile with a new hue and color. there are several spots where you can stay like the solitude and brighton ski resort. we drove till the end of road. There is the silver lake at that spot which has a pathway that goes around it. View from here is awesome and we have found snow till the end of May in those slopes. There are a couple of restaurants up there in the ski resorts as well. Carry water and munchies if you want to hike the other lakes that are well hidden in the mountains. The trek would start form the silver lake of course. All in all a great place with a great geological significance as you get to see the cliffs/hills that remnants of the ancient sea (look for signboards that highlight these). there is a small waterfall (on the right when you drive up) and an ampitheatre (on the left) this waterfall is rough when there is ice in the mountains but quite dry in the summer months. The ride is good, the roads are new and the numerous trails, worth a climb. I know people camp there but have never tried on my own."

There are numerous hiking trails along the canyon so I would recommend searching around online for something that seems interesting to you and give it a shot!

Hiking is limitless with day-hikes throughout the canyon to backpacking or cross canyon excursions (see local published guides) . There are also short level walks around the lake at Brighton.
The creeks are fast with limited fishing the lakes are more popular.
The Autumns are colorful and rival anywhere and amaze that they are such a short drive from the center of Salt Lake City. Access to the canyons is the reason so many people live here. Go enjoy, don't forget to smile."

This is a generous reward for the drive from Salt Lake City. Hint; If you plan to hike the longer trails take the boardwalk to the right from the Visitor's Center and it will be shorter to your to choices.

Drive up to the top where Brighton Ski Resort is located, then slowly wind your way back.

When we reached the Brighton Ski area we parked in the large lot, and ventured out to the Silver Lake trail behind the visitor center. There s a very stroller and wheel chair friendly trail that circles the lake. When you reach the one of the ends of the far side of the lake you have the opportunity to continue in a much more rugged trail to Lake Solitude. We went near the middle of June, and there were still spots of snow on the trail around Silver Lake. I am from Pennsylvania so this really impressed me. I had never seen snow before in June. I was in flip flops, but I decided to hike the upward trail to Lake Solitude any way. It was worth the effort. We saw three deer and wild life. There were beautiful views of the canyon. At one point on the trail it is important that you bear left or you will end up down a long hill at a ski lodge. Fortunately we were able to follow people ahead of us who had stopped to watch the passing wild life. The trail got steep toward Lake Solitude and it was rough to do it in flip flops, but I am a rather adventurous type. It is about a one mile trail one way, and we were able to rest, drink water and have a snack at the lake. The chip monks there are very friendly ""or aggressive"" and will beg for food. Going down the trail when it is muddy is more challenging than climbing it.
We stopped at a restaurant in the Brighton Recreation Area, but it was closed. On our drive back there is a popular bar and restaurant about half way down on the right. ""The Silver Fork Lodge"". The food was great, but it was little expensive.
This trip is a must do if you are visiting Salt Lake City. It only took us a half day to complete, and it was worth the rental car fee. I would do it again, only next time I would choose different shoes. We would have loved to have done Zion Canyon, but it is 4 hours away."

Lots of trails for hiking in the summer and snowshoeing in the winter. The Crest trail is one of the best mountain bike trails around. Also, both Brighton and Solitude are located in this canyon and are both great ski resorts, popular with the locals. Solitude is especially good during the weekdays as there are very small crowds but great skiing terrain. Brighton is popular with the snowboarding crowd.
Some of my favorite hikes are in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Dog Lake tops the list. Also, lots of preset rock climbing routes can be found in the canyon as well. The Slips is a popular rock climbing area with climbs of various ratings. Best part about the canyon is that it is only minutes from the Valley. No charge to get up the canyon and the hikes and rock climbs are free. Ski resorts to charge. Check their websites for current pricing."

BCC is part of the Wasatch Mountain Range. There are some challenging hikes as well as some easy hikes during the spring, summer and fall. Please go to http://hikesandlakes.com/bigcottonwoodcanyon.html for a description of the hikes available and how to reach them. Be sure to have breakfast or lunch at the Silver Fork lodge on the way up the canyon. There are parts of the canyon where dogs are not allowed because it is a watershed area. Be sure to verify before bringing your canine hiking companion. Also, be weather wise for storms if on the forecast as lightning can be an issue. 6,500 to 10,000 ft. elevation. Dress with layers and bring water/food.
During ski season, there are immediate area hotels in Cottonwood Heights and Sandy, Utah, which means you can be up the ski hill in 25 to 40 minutes. Ski buses pick up boarders and ski buffs at the parking lot at the base of BCC.
There are also ski season and summer rentals up the mountain. Many are connected to Solitude Resort or Brighton Resort. Not all trails give access to bicycles. No ATVs or motorcycles on hiking trails. These are mountain trails and not wheel chair accessible.
Enjoy this beautiful area."

The mountains are breathtaking! We are still acclimating to the higher elevation it seems, but some of the hikes are still doable for us. Even just driving you'll get some great views, but the hiking is even more beautiful.
Silver Lake is more of a walk for those who can't ""hike,"" but it is at a very high elevation. We have even seen a moose! If unable to hike/walk around the lake, at least drive up to see it. It's literally right down the road from Brighton ski resort.
The Donut Falls hike isn't as strenuous as other hikes, but be warned it may be difficult in a few spots for little kids. We encountered a mom with three little ones, and my husband all but carried two of the kids across the river there and back, but even if you just go as far as the river and turn around, you've still seen very beautiful views. Also, we have seen a moose right off the road by the main parking lot here.
Just a note, as it was confusing to us at first, I wouldn't recommend parking in the parking lot on the main canyon road; take a right and head down the narrow road to the head of the trail, unless you feel up to a very long walk, the hike, then another very long walk back to your car. Parking is quite limited at the trailhead though."

Our teachers were simply wonderful. Don Johnson, my teacher, really improved my technique and confidence (my 4th lesson). But in March, we thought we'd try an area we hadn't skied, And Alta is always high on everyone's list. So, we tried it. Not fun. For one, the lessons for kids are huge in scale, they didn't pay much attention to individuals. Second, for my lesson, the guy gave me no help and instilled fear of skiing in me. I decided it was time to return to Solitude. That was the best decision! I found Don again, by chance, and he showed me how I was leaning back, gave me exercises to improve my technique and had me enjoying myself and doing much better by the end of the lesson going down Moonbeam. He basically saved skiing for me. He even had notes on me from December! The long beginner's hill was much better for my sister in law. It is small, intimate and caring. And no lines.

It always seemed that the hikes near Salt Lake City were overused and underwhelming. Although Big Cottonwood Canyon is a busy place, a group of friends hiked up to Lake Solitude last week and found, well, solitude. And no mosquitoes. The trail starts at the Silver Lake center (restrooms available) and is a pretty easy 1.5 mile hike up to a small, yet pretty lake. Anyone (almost, there is a somewhat steep short portion just before arriving at the lake) could do this easy trail. I recommend it for a little morning getaway. We headed up the trail around 10 a.m. We only saw a very few people on our way up, then had the lake to ourselves for about 20 minutes. On our way back down the trail we passed quite a few people as they ventured up. Now I regret not doing more cerca-City exploring over the years. It was really a delightful morning."

In 10 minutes, you can be off of I-215 and into a rugged, mountainous chasm on the way to waterfalls, woods, and alpine lakes and peaks.
Besides the obvious (skiing), I've enjoyed sport climbing, hiking, snowshoeing, camping, scrambling, and picnicking in Big Cottonwood. It is a great place for all of the above.
Parking is either excellent or challenging, depending upon the crowds and where you plan to go (Silver Lake Trailhead: easy, S-Curve Trailhead: tougher on a busy summer day unless you get there early).
Lake Blanche is a prototypical alpine lake: clear, beautiful water with wildflowers below and craggy peaks above. The lake is a great place to start if you are wanting to delve deeper into the Wasatch Range, away from the roads and ski resorts."

Martha and Cathrine are for the die-hard's because once you get to Mary's its hard to leave it but please do yourself a favor and press on, its worth it.
For a easier way to see the sisters, go up Little Cottonwood Canyon, go to Albien Basin and you'll find Cathrine pass... going downhill the whole time makes it easier for the younger or inexperienced ones. Bring lots of water or a filter for the lakes. Its a water shed area, leave the dogs at home."

Be prepared for hairpin turns, a beautiful stream (be careful not to polute anything in the pristine canyons).
Look out for rock climbers ... tiny dots on the granite faces. There are places to hike and cross country ski. Solitude is one of my favorite ski areas when the snow is fresh and the sun shines ... otherwise not that great. Brighton is great on a snowy day because there are many trails through the trees.

Most of these start up near Guardsman Pass. The views are absolutely stunning. The trails can get busy on weekends. There are some beautiful lakes - some of the best hiking photos I've taken. Take plenty of fluid and wear sunscreen, as with any hike in this region. It is amazing how close this fantastic valley is to the city. Take advantage of it!"

This is a beautiful alpine lake with an easy boardwalk loop around most of the lake.The lake was clear and while I didn't see any bears or moose, I am sure they were out there.

Why keep coming back?
-On the slopes just 5 hours after leaving home from the bayous of Louisiana. Delta non-stop from New Orleans to SLC- Arrives 10:30am, departs 5:30pm.
Salt Lake City airport to Solitude just 35-40 minutes (rental car or shuttle). Can be skiing with a half-day ticket on first day and can ski right up to the shuttle, pop your skis off, hop in and head to the airport on last day (if you own your own equipment).
-Price of equipment and tickets are very reasonable.
We purchase season tickets off the website in the late summer / early fall. Packages are very good. Our son skis for $25.00/day (lift ticket) as a junior and total rental package is $25.00/day. Husband $49.00/day for lift ticket. Equipment is quality.
-Friendly, knowledgeable, dedicated staff
From the manager of the Solitude’s Snowsports Academy, Leif, to the seasonal workers (ski instructors, rental area, lift operators), we always feel completely welcomed and properly cared for. We have been using the same instructors for years and would highly recommend both, Ron Cook and Helen. Both will up your skiing game every time you ski with them. Ski trips are about skiing. Do not torture yourself. Spend some money on instruction. My son skis double blacks and Ron improves his skills every time and no one knows those dangerous Honeycomb runs like Ron. Worth every penny.
-No lines. No waits for all that beautiful snow.
-Great lodging and helpful, friendly staff.
-Big Cottonwood canyon is seldom closed due to avalanches. Road closures can really ruin your limited vacation time.
-Good, quality food at lodge and at Silver Fork Lodge.
-Snow, snow, snow!!!
The list goes on and on."

What a drive. I loved the scenery so much that I did it two days in a row. The trees, mountains, streams. You name it. Big Cottonwood has it. Great hiking too. Lake Blanche trail should not be missed. Continuing up the mountain you will pass by several ski resorts and continue to the small town of Brighton. There you will find a very tranquil and beautiful walk around Silver Lake. This is a real alpine lake and the scenery is splendid. Half way around the lake, there is a cut off to the twin lakes trail. Easy trail with a 700 ft incline in a 1 1/2 miles. Outstanding!
From Brighton, you can take the road up to Guardsman Pass at 11000 feet elevation. You are on top of the world at this point. The views are unparrelled.
From Guardsman Pass you drive down the mountain and take the cut off to Midway. Again another spectacular drive. Have a picnic lunch at the visitor center in Midway. After that, take the drive up to Snake Canyon...Scenery here does not get much better......Can't wait to do it again. We were very fortunate as the foliage was almost peaking throughout out drives. The reds, oranges, the contrast with the evergreens and of course the golden leaves of the aspen trees. What a sight anf lots of colorful memories."

With one evening to do sightseeing, this was a great choice. The drive up the canyon was picturesque, and not at all like what I was expecting. We saw rock climbers along the way, and I was thinking my son would have loved it here. We were headed for the Silver Fork, but decided to look around before dinner while we still had daylight. The walk around Spring Lake at then end of the drive was a must-do. We had hoped to see some moose, but not today. I was surprised to realize we were over 8000 feet elevation - it didn't feel like it. And the cool, dry air was a pleasant change from the 95F in the city. After dinner, we continued up some side roads until it got dark, and headed back to our hotel. The side roads were not for the faint of heart - steep drop-offs and no guardrails!

I took her to a favorite trail of mine and we hit the trail. Parking at the 'S' curve, we headed up the Broads Fork trail. Within minutes we were in another world. Sure we could hear the cars streaming up and down the canyon, but the aroma of pine trees and wild flowers melted the din into an unobtrusive aside.
We both loved just being out in the wild, unattached and undeterred by the electronic junk that dominates our day to day living. yes, we had no cell service - HOORAY!
45 minutes up the trail (probably 25 for the faster moving crowd) we came upon a huge rock. We paused to enjoy its unique form and then continued up a ways. We passed only 2 other people on our trek up and I pondered the proximity to more than a million people only a few miles away, and here we were in solitude.
After an hour we turned back and quickly retraced our steps. The trail was alot steeper on the way down, but we managed. Soon we arrived back at the parking lot and rested by the rushing waters of the mountain stream. We didn't want to leave and so we just basked in the overpowering sound of the rushing water.
You know we will be back"

The mountain scenery, especially with late snow on the peaks, is fantastic. But be forewarned - the trail systems leave a lot to be desired, particularly in regard to signage. I have hiked in NH, ME, VT, MA, CT, NY, WY, CO, and MT, but have never seen a trail system that is totally unmarked like the trail system in the Wasatch Mountains.
Most trail heads are unmarked other than by a sign saying ""Trail"". A bit further on, there'll be sign saying ""Stay on the trail"". That is usually followed by a number of heavily trodden trails going in multiple directions, with no designation of which is the correct one. Trying to determine which is correct is impossible, since all appear to be maintained, with waterbars and stone steps. And yet., printed trail maps show only one distinct trail. If you're lucky enough to not get totally lost, you'll be rewarded with fantastic views, but will only have a vague idea of where you are. The comment of the 'locals' is ""Well, you get used to it."" Big canyon, small canyon, it dosen't matter, they're all the same. Good luck!"

Now I've lived in Salt Lake for years and still haven't explored every area of this canyon. There is always something new to challenge. Most people will just drive up and down or do a couple of short hikes or picnics. But there are literally hundreds of trails to inspire.
There is a connection with the natural world and extreme wilderness so close to a major urban center, which is a unique feature most cities don't have. Every season has options, from skiing to climbing, biking or hiking. The real canyon must be explored away from the car and road. Here is where you will encounter moose, mountain goats, and view Salt Lake City from 10,000 foot mountain peaks. That view must be earned.
If nothing else, it's always a nice day heading up the canyon relaxing."

At the top of the canyon are Brighton and Alta, both great skiing destinations in winter, but in summer they are equally beautiful.
Silver Lake offers a nature center, a boardwalk, and an interpretive trail which connects up with trails to Silver lake and Lake Solitude.

(If I remember correctly, one was formed by a glacier, the other by a river.) It's about a 20 minute drive from downtown SLC to the mouth of the canyon, and about another 20 minutes to the top of the canyon.

There are so many places to explore, but Big Cottonwood Canyon is one of the best places to start. My favorite place to go is Silver Lake. It's a great place to take a walk, or enjoy a picnic lunch. If you are feeling more adventurous, there are also several lakes you can hike to from there. (Hope you remembered to bring your camera or phone to take pictures!)
For hiking ideas, there is a place you can get information at the start of the Silver Lake trail. There are also restrooms there.
The trails to Twin Lake and Lake Solitude start on the North side of Silver Lake. From the fork, you can go left to Twin Lake or Right to Lake Solitude.
Twin Lake: My favorite part of the trail to Twin Lake is the section that cuts through an aspen forest. After that the trail gets pretty rocky and I didn't enjoy that as much in the hot sun. Not the best trail to hike mid-day! When I arrived at Twin Lake (Reservoir) I was a little disappointed with the view and not sure if I would care to hike this trail again. My sister and I decided to take a ""short cut"" down the road on the way back and I don't recommend doing that. It was faster, yes, but too steep for me. I'd rather go back the way I came next time even if it's longer. Too hard on my knees. Guess I'm a wimp. :)
Lake Solitude: This was my favorite trail to hike. Beautiful aspens, lots of wildflowers, deer...and possibly other wildlife. This trail felt very isolated to me, I wouldn't feel very comfortable hiking this one alone, but I could do this trail again and again. The lake at the end of the trail looked like a moose pond. It wasn't big, but it was pretty. Definitely a place of ""solitude.""
___________
Dog Lake/Lake Mary: This trail starts out at Brighton Ski Resort. The beginning of the trail is pretty steep, it begins right up the hill near the ski lift. The trail is easy to follow from there. (Restrooms back at Silver Lake) It was a nice trail that just seems to keep going up, up, up. Bring water...and a picnic lunch while you're at it. Dog Lake was a nice, easy, short walk to a very pretty and isolated moose pond. (No moose when I was there) Worth the short walk to see it, for sure! The trail to Lake Mary is also worth the hike. I wasn't disappointed once the picturesque lake (reservoir) came into view. I was glad I brought my camera! There were several families up there enjoying a picnic and I was wishing I was more prepared...maybe next time."

Be prepared to stay a while. There are hikes for all ages and abilities. A great hike for children and the elderly is up close to Brighton Ski resort. Its called Silver Lake. It makes a nice big, pretty much level, loop around this small lake. If you want to extend this hike you can go to Lake Solitude for a wonderful view. It is more of an up hill hike but so worth it. You will often see moose up this canyon and deer. In August the wildflowers up in the Albion Basin area are spectacular. The hike to Donut Falls, about 1/2 way up the canyon is also a nice one. There are several great camp grounds up this canyon. The Spruces and Redmonds are 2 of my favorites."

(See the website listed with this review.) We took seven young children ages 11 months to ten years. All made it safely. The trail is relatively smooth and well groomed until the very end. You can stop at the base of the falls or continue on the rocks to get closer to the falls. The scenery is beautiful and the length is perfect for young hikers . . . It's less than a mile each way. There is a pit toilet at the trail head and limited parking nearby (about 20 spaces). We wend on a summer weekday, but apparently you can go year round, if you like to snowshoe in the winter."

Enjoy the greatest snow on earth at Solitude and Brighton ski resorts. Cross country, downhill, snow boarding ... it is a winter wonderland. Snow usually lingers well into spring and sometimes into summer at the higher elevations. We've camped in snow in June and experienced snowfall in August.
My favorite time of the year in Big Cottonwood is summer. It's a great place to escape the summer heat for a picnic, a hike or a weekend campout. There are several picnic areas and trailheads just off the road. Three camp areas are usually very busy all summer. We have an annual family reunion at Jordan Pines (group sites only). Spruces and Redman campgrounds have single and group camp sites.
Storm Mountain is very popular for picnics, hiking and rock climbing. Donut Falls and Silver Lake are popular destinations. Other hikes take the adventurous higher and deeper into the mountains. The canyon road is popular with bicyclists. The creek provides some fun fishing.
Big Cottonwood Canyon is certainly a treasure in the Wasatch Mountains!"

The hike to Mary's Lake is fun and scenic. Trails are fun for all age groups. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in addition to skiing in winter.

With young kids, we love the Silver Lake walk at the base of Brighton ski resort. We have seen moose in the shallows here about a third of the time, munching away on the water plants. The rangers come out and keep you at a safe distance. There are dozens of trails for hikes into waterfalls, with widely varying levels of difficulty. Donut Falls is popular and can be crowded in summer. There are many internet sites that describe the various trails, and it is worth doing some research in advance. The Silver Fork Restaurant is about half way up the canyon. Its deck is very popular for summer weekend brunches and as an after ski place in the winter. The Porcupine Grill at the base of the Canyon in SLC is another after ski hot spot for beer, pizza, and pub food."

A popular hike in both Winter and Summer is doughnut falls. I go up there mostly to Rock Climb because it is a good place with a variety of difficulties.

It was such a stark contrast literally one side old town quiet then Nevada big brash and riotously alive all summed up by Wendover Will as historically important as Vegas Vic.
A bit of history below from wiki
Pat Denner was commissioned to design the sign for the Stateline Casino in 1952. Denner had just completed the Vegas Vic sign that was erected in 1951. The sign was constructed by The Young Electric Sign Company.
Wendover Will was named after the town of Wendover and William Smith, who founded the Stateline Casino. The 63-foot-tall (19 m) sign was intended to draw travelers in from US Highways 40 and 50, later known as Interstate 80. The sign includes 1,184 feet (361 m) of neon tubing.[2] When driving east on Interstate 80 a caption under the sign reads, ""This is the place,"" apparently in homage to Brigham Young. When driving west the caption reads, ""Where the West begins""."

At the Montego Bay Casino, there's a restored Lincoln Hwy marker--a later alignment of the Lincoln was routed to Wendover then down to Ely.

Wendover Will used to sit by one of the casinos some years ago, but now he has been relocated to the west side of town, on the old highway leading out to rejoin the interstate.
