WOW - What a great way to end my visit. The views are beyond amazing, bring a camera but don't forgot to just soak up the experience.

Definitely a must do if you are in Yellowstone."

From the falls to the hoo doos there is so much color here.
Our experience began on the north side of the canyon where there are fewer visitors. A switchback trail takes one down around 600 feet to catch a view of the falls. You do need to remember though that, at 8000ft in elevation, the climb back up should be done slowly to respect the lower oxygen levels (unless, of course, you're acclimatized to these altitudes).
While the number of visitors on this side of the canyon are fewer I'd still recommend getting here early in the day if for no other reason than to catch the morning light on the water. During our visit the skies were starting to fill up with the haze from the forest fires in Oregon and California which created an almost otherworldly color palette to photograph."

Both areas have easy to access scenic overlooks with great views and very little walking. You can easily see waterfalls. The only exception is the Brink of the Lower Falls - this is a steep descent of 600 feet in 3/8 of a mi and you need to also climb back up. The Brink took us 25 min to walk up and down. All the other spots on the North and South Rim were easy to do and we spent anywhere from 10 - 15 minutes at each spot.
The North Rim was nice and quiet in the morning at around 8 am. We spent around 1 hr and 15 minutes there.
For the South Rim, we spent around 45 minutes total time there with 10 - 15 minutes each at Artist Point and Uncle Tom's Point."

It expresses the park's complex geologic history in dramatic colors and shapes. Puffs of steam mark hydrothermal features in the canyon's walls. The Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River add to the grandeur of the unique natural treasure.
We viewed it from the North and South Rim and from lookout, inspiration and artists points. Unfortunately the brink was closed during our visit but I would have loved to get a workout and get that close to the falls.
We went about 8:30 am to beat the crowds and spent about 2 hours there. Make sure you take a lot of pictures and videos but it does not do it justice when you come home and look at them. Enjoy."

The colors of this canyon with the waterfall are just remarkable! Standing here, it feels like you’re in an actual drawing! There are several ways to access and view the Grand Canyon of YellowStone. If you look through the online tour, it will help you pin point which ones you want to visit.
-Brink of Lower Falls trail is HIGHLY RECOMMMENDED!!! It’s .4 mile down and back up so it is a little strenuous but takes you to the very top of the waterfall. The view from here is absolutely incredible!!! Not only are you right at the rush water of top of the fall, but the view down the canyon is breaktaking.
-Another good trail is Red Rock Point which is just as strenuous down, .3 miles, and back up but it takes you to the lower part of the falls.
-Inspiration Point and Artist Point are both near parking and short walks to the overlook with some of the best views. Uncle Tom’s trail takes you into the canyon for great views. It was unfortunately closed when we visited the park.
-Many places along the canyon has parking for you to drive around, park and visit. Parking areas are designated in the image to the left."

What is here: The dramatic, 1,000-foot-deep Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone rewards visitors with dazzling views of multi-hued rock walls and majestic waterfalls. With walking and hiking trails for all abilities, and learning opportunities for the whole family, it’s easy to spend an entire day in this unique area of the park.
The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is roughly 20 miles long and varies from 1,500 to 4,000 feet wide. Geologists believe it was formed as the Yellowstone River eroded softer, less resistant rock that had been weakened by hydrothermal gases and hot water.
The colorful canyon is a natural work of art: streaks of red, orange, gold, black, and even green decorate the canyon walls. Several miles of trails connect 10 primary overlooks that afford dramatic views from both sides of the canyon.
When we went there had been snowfall and it made the most beautiful pictures since it was combined with all of the colors of the canyon.
Whether it’s your first visit to Yellowstone, or you visit regularly, everyone loves a summer day in the park. Here’s how to get the most out of yours.
The best way to experience all the different facets of the canyon’s charm is to pick a trail and go for a hike. There are many trails along both canyon rims, from short jaunts to all-day treks. Here are a few of our favorites:
Brink of the Lower Falls Trail (moderate):
Descend 600 feet on a steep trail to get an up-close and personal view of the Lower Falls in all its thundering power. 0.7 miles, round-trip
Seven Mile Hole Trail (strenuous):
You’ll want to commit a whole day to this trail – the only one that leads to the canyon bottom.10.2 miles, round-trip
Point Sublime Trail (easy):
After visiting the Artist Point overlook, follow the South Rim Trail beyond Artist Point to this less-traveled path, which meanders along the canyon rim to the aptly named Point Sublime. 1.3 miles from Artist Point to Point Sublime
View the Canyon and Falls
While some views of the canyon and falls are only accessible by trail, you can still get to the following overlooks by car and a short walk from the parking lots on paved, accessible walkways.
From North Rim Drive: View the Lower Falls from Lookout Point, Red Rock Point, Grand View, and Inspiration Point. Both waterfalls are visible from Brink of the Lower Falls.
From South Rim Drive: See the Upper Falls from two viewpoints at Uncle Tom’s Point. View the Lower Falls at Artist Point.
Several of the canyon overlooks and trails, which were originally built in the 1930s, are being rehabilitated with support from Yellowstone Forever. Over the years, they have been hammered by unforgiving weather, compromised by soil erosion, and damaged by increased visitation. In recent years, these conditions have prompted some temporary or long-term closures."

Their intensity varies with the weather and time of day. Due to the iron content in the rock (largely rhyolite) the reds are like the iron rusting. The yellows are not sulfur but other chemical reactions affecting the iron. It all makes for gorgeous scenery.
Be sure to walk down to the top of the stairway because on that corner there is a great view of the falls cascading down and glimpses of the river. There are many spectacular places in the Park, but don’t miss this one."

Parking was still available and the temperature was still on the cool side. There are several stops on each side of the canyon. When we visited, some were closed for construction (Brink of Upper Falls, North & South Rim Trails & Uncle Tom's Trail). On the South Rim we stopped at Uncle Tom’s Point (great views of Upper Falls) and Artist Point. On the North Rim we stopped at Brink of Lower Falls, Red Rock Point, Lookout Point, Grand View and Inspiration Point. My favorite was Artist Point, the views are excellent from here. Parking lots at most of the spots are big enough for several cars. Most of the sites are within easy walking from the parking lots. The only exceptions are Brink of the Lower Falls and Red Rock Point, the trails drop steeply about 600 feet. The artist Thomas Moran painted many variations of the canyon on his travels here which in turn helped Yellowstone become the first National Park. I recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the day to avoid the crowds and find a parking spot."

The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is the most breathtaking beauty of the Yellowstone National Park. This 24 mile long canyon with depth varying from 800 to 1200 ft and width varying from 1500 to 4000 ft at places attests to the potential erosive force of the Yellowstone River. From several vantage points, one can view Lower Falls plunging steeply into the canyon 308 feet, or the Upper Falls tumbling 109 feet. This is the only canyon that sports steam vents and geysers marked by mineral strains on its wall.
For thousands of years, upwardly percolating fluids have altered the chemistry of the rocks, turning them yellow, red, white, and pink. A beautiful picturesque setting!
Once upon a time when the old geyser basin was active, it contributed to the ""cooking"" of the rock bringing about chemical alterations in the canyon's iron compounds. The rocks are essentially rusting. The colors indicate the presence or absence of water in the individual iron compounds. Most of the yellows in the canyon are the result of iron present in the rock rather than sulfur, as many people think."

But not this one. We were totally surprised by the size - depth, width, length - of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.
We sat through an interesting, but brief, Ranger talk at Artist's Point, and then spent a good hour enjoying the view from that area. This is the view that Thomas Moran painted in 1871 and which became part of the inspiration for Congress to create the first national park in the world, and for President Grant to sign the bill into law.
We also took it in from Lookout Point and Grand View - totally worth taking in both the South Rim and North Rim drives."

This is the fault of Congress, not the National Parks Service, which has a $12 billion maintenance backlog. If you love your national parks, call your member of Congress and complain about their underfunding of parks. It matters here, where the only thing keeping your precious child from falling over a sheer cliff is a broken fence.

My wife had suggested Yellowstone as a destination and I knew it was going to be impressive, but I had no idea what kind of things we were going to find there. So, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was a total surprise.
We saw it on the map, but didn't really take it seriously. Even when we parked the car and followed the clear signposts: it looked like a river carving its own little canyon. But when we stood on the lip of that canyon and looked down at the river and the sulphur deposits that decorated the sides of the enormous canyon! Grand Canyon is no exaggeration. This place is absolutely spectacular. We just couldn't get enough of it.
Well-marked trails. Safe and well-chosen viewpoints. It was all aid out for us. But we didn't even mind the crowds. Glimpses of coloured deposits turned into dazzling, dramatic canyon views as we made our way through the surrounding trees.
We lingered longer than we expected. It never got old."

I was a little worried that my expectations were too high. I felt like it looked fake in everyone's pictures. I can now say, it met and exceeded my expectations! It is so beautiful that it does look fake.
We drove both the north and south rim to see the different viewpoints. We got to the north rim first, which the ranger said will get more backed up as the day goes on. We didn't have any trouble finding parking, and we were there around 8:30 am. We hiked the trail to the Brink of the Lower Falls and the Red Rock Trail. Both were beautiful and worth it.
The Brink of the Upper Falls and Uncle Tom's Trail was closed when we were here on June 25.
We did drive on the South Rim Road to Artist's Point is a must as well. This area is very awe-inspiring."

There are two drives one on the north side of the canyon and one on the south side. The road along the north side is one way and loops back to the canyon visitor center. The views of the huge waterfall is amazing. There are trails or stairs that take you down to see the falls from close to river level but it is a long hard trip back to the parking area. The first stop at brink of the lower falls is one of the best views. Inspiration Point is the last stop on the north rim drive and the view from there is fantastic. All of the overlooks are well worth the time but the first and last to me are best. This drive can be very crowded and there may be waits to find a parking spot. If you can get there early in the day you will have less issues. The south rim drive is a road in and the same path back out. There are several overviews to view the upper falls and all are great. The last is artist point and it to me is the best view. All overviews are an easy walk from the parking. I did not expect the canyon to be one of my favorite things in the park but it was. Don’t miss it."

Think we drove through the viewing area on the North side of the canyon (upper) closest to the lodge. Plenty of vehicles, and in fact, parking was at a premium. Thus, 4 stars instead of 5. We enjoyed the various viewpoints that line the parking area, and worked our way all along it. Because the wife was still recuperating from a foot operation, we did not trudge very far down any trails, but we did fine at the viewpoints, some of which have stairways that take you down to overlooks that seem to be right on top of the canyon. It's fun looking at the falls from a distance and watching the way the river churns through the canyon. Loved the canyon and the crevices and precipices, and it was even fun watching folks on the other side of the canyon. But you had better bring binoculars if you really want to savor the details. A hailstorm eventually drove us back to our car and the safety of the cocktail lounge in the village. So there's that, too! Great to have a martini waiting nearby."

Artist Point is the best and best known so expect crowds. Parking is pretty good, but restrooms are limited so expect long lines. We stayed at Lake Lodge the first night in the park and did the wile east side in one day - the canyon is on the east side above fishing bridge and the road to Cody. The canyon has to be one of your “must see” stops in the park."

I’m however dropping one star due to practicalities - disappointment that several of the trails (including the Uncle Tom Steps) going into the high season are out of use, and also the parking (on the North Rim) - even in early June - is difficult, so goodness knows what it will be like in July/August.

The best light was surprisingly at noon as it lit up the rock to show the yellow stone of Yellowstone!
There will always be loads of people here, but if you can get here early, head to the North part of the canyon first. Walk down to the top of the waterfall (which was very worthwhile despite the uphill climb back) and also walk along the north canyon trail to Artists Point to avoid crowds and have easy parking.
Also worth going to see the Upper Falls, quick and easy and you realise how fast the water is flowing. Often rainbows here.

Had the benefit of arriving early and dealing with no crowds.
Tip for this site and others all over Yellowstone - GET THERE EARLY! If you don't get started until 9am or later, you're dooming yourself to hassle. The best way to see anything in the park is to get out early and make occasional time to see things after dinner.
The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a must-see stop."

This part of the park is a must see, since it is why the park is called “Yellowstone.” From these overlooks peering into the gorge, you can see the yellow walls of the canyon that gave Yellowstone its name.
We visited in late September, and got early starts at the first light of dawn. We were rewarded with incredible views of this area, and at most of the overlooks, we had the park to ourselves. Don’t pay any attention to comparisons to the actual Grand Canyon or to Niagara Falls. Each of the national parks we have visited have their own special beauty and we appreciate each of their unique vistas. The views of Yellowstone Canyon were just extraordinary.
We visited North Rim Drive first. This is a one way loop where you can drive and stop at the successive viewpoints to admire this breathtaking area. This worked well for us, since we really don’t hike, but could still experience incredible views with very little effort. We stopped at all of the easy points along the way; Brink of the Lower Falls, Lookout Point, Grandview, and Inspiration Point. Each of these views gave a different view of the gorge and the Lower Falls, and every different view was amazing. Some tourists skip these views and only go to Artists Point. What a huge mistake! Spend the time to explore these other views. You won’t be disappointed!
Just an FYI. The signage for Inspiration Point is very confusing. The first sign you see is not Lookout Point. It is a trail that has sheer drop-offs, and really should be cordoned off for safety. The actual observation point is at the next sign, and is an area that just opened up from construction. This overlook has numerous steps to the view, and is absolutely stunning. The park really did a great job at this site. Always look for official park signs with maps, which mark the actual overlooks.
We then headed back toward Canyon Junction, and turned south to pick up South Rim Drive toward Artists Point. We stopped at the Brink of the Upper Falls, but didn’t go all the way to the observation point. It was somewhat steep, and too difficult for us. We then passed Uncle Tom’s Point, which was still closed for construction. It was supposed to be open by September of 2018, but apparently it is taking longer than expected.
Artists Point is one of the busier parts of the part. It is probably the most visited of the Yellowstone Grand Canyon overlooks. The view from here is absolutely incredible. Definitely a primo selfie shot! It’s a good idea to get here early, and definitely be patient. Many people setup camera tripods, and there were only a few “holes” in the prime areas for the rest of us to take pictures. But if you persevere, you will get some great shots.
We are so glad we spent a couple of hours here to enjoy the many exquisite views of Yellowstone Canyon. If you love beautiful scenic views, you’ll love this part of Yellowstone!"

But it is big enough and beautiful enough to stir your emotions. Surely, it is one of the most popular attractions in Yellowstone National Park. It is the first large canyon on the Yellowstone River downstream from Yellowstone Falls. It is about 24 miles long, 800 to 1,200 feet in depth and from a quarter-mile to three quarters-of-a-mile wide. Like the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, it is an erosional feature, not a result of glaciation. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than glaciation. Today, it still is being eroded by the Yellowstone River. Perhaps the most picturesque features of the canyon are the upper and lower falls. But there are other important landmarks, including Agate Creek, Artist Point, Calcite Spring, Cascade Creek, Inspiration Point, Grand View, Lookout Point, Overhanging Cliff, Point Sublime, 7-Mile Hole and Silver Cord Cascade. For ambitious and curious tourists who want to get a closer view of the canyon and the lower falls, perhaps the canyon's most spectacular feature, they are encouraged to tackle the Uncle Tom's Trail, which is a three-mile hike along the steep stairway down the base of the lower falls."

The auto trip that we took from Florida to see this wonderful event was well worth it. We had purchased several years ago The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass so we were able to get into the park without paying an extra fee. We have the Senior Pass. We got to the site where Old Faithful would make a show for all to see. There were may seats available around the area yet people had to sit on the concrete at our feet due to the crowd waiting for the Geyser to erupt. When it erupted on time, the display went on for about three minutes. It was wonderful!
Other things that we was were people fishing in the streams, people watching other eruptions in several other spots in the park, and last but not least a bison walking up the side of the road."

There are several viewing platform areas - take the time to check them all out. Each one gives a different perspective and angle. The sheer size of the canyon, coupled with the drama of fast-falling water, plus the unusual color of the rock walls make this a must-see. See if you can spot a few small steam vents in the canyon walls.
There's a great, short video on the NPS site about the falls. It contains excellent, concise information that will aide you before your visit.
In a huge, must-see national park filled with must-see attractions, I can see why some might miss this one. If, like most people, you enter YNP from the south gate and travel, clockwise, you will have to travel a bit to get to the canyon. Ideally, it will be your second or third day of your visit.
Do not miss out. If you enjoy nature (which is why we visit Yellowstone, right?) take the time to see this part. While the thermal features are like visiting another planet, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is one of the most beautiful parts of this planet."

With some of the exposed rock in black color, it makes for an interesting and surreal image, almost like looking at a painting. Also, the Grand Canyon in Yellowstone is closer to the observation viewpoints, which gives it a more intimate feeling. This is a must see attraction. Both the Lookout Point on the North Rim Drive and the Artist Point on the South Rim Drive offers great vantage points of both the Lower Falls and the Canyon. The Calcite Springs Overlook also offers a great vantage point for just the Canyon itself and is less crowded."

They are all stunning. You will also never see the exact view of the Moran painting because it is a compilation of views. Bring your hiking boots. Hike the north lower falls trails and do it at dawn. No one will be there and your drive through the park to get to the canyon will be unmatched. Steam rising everywhere, fog patches, foraging animals, and then the hike down to the crest of the falls. The mist at dawn catches sunlight and reflects colors from the walls. Hike the northern rim after - its relatively flat. You’ll mostly be alone or meet a couple of other dawn enthusiasts."

The river is a much more brilliant green next to the amazingly colorful palette of the Canyon walls. There are many lookout points on both north and south rims. Stop at all of them if you have the time, but if not, here are 3 of my favorites:
Artist Point - on the south rim, gives you a sweeping, distant view of the falls. Tends to get overcrowded so best to go early or late in the day. For more solitude and more views of the Canyon hike a bit on the Point Sublime trail (look for the sign marked Ribbon Lake). Trail is a mile one way but no need to go all the way as the best views are half way in.
Brink of Lower Falls - right off the north rim drive, requires a very steep hike down and up (0.75 miles one way) to the viewing platform. A must see if you like standing almost next to the bottom of a huge thundering waterfall.
Brink of Upper Falls - Off the loop road just south of the north rim drive - not far from the parking lot, just a few steps down. We stopped here as a last minute add on at the end of the day but it was totally worth it. Nothing like being right next to a raging river rushing towards the lip of the fall. If you like the deafening noise of water plunging down this is a good spot to be.
In addition to the Canyon and falls, we also found the stretch of the loop road between Tower and Canyon junctions to have the best bear sightings. Two in one day - grizzly and black bear with cub!"

It has lots of people on the trail and feels safe. Take time coming up and enjoy the views. Powerful to stand next to them. Then be sure to see the Brink of upper falls which is an easy short walk from parking lot. And finally Artist Point has some amazing views across the canyon to see the falls. Disappointed Uncle Tom’s trails down the canyon side was closed due to construction but if you visit these 3 spots you can still see it all.

Artist Point has undoubtedly the best view of the canyon, and is one of the most photographed spots in the park.
After that do the North Rim, which is usually less crowded. The North Rim has great hikes with various entry points along the Rim. The hikes range from I would say 1-2 miles - so they’re short, but relatively steep. We did it with 10 and 12-yr old boys, and they were completely fine doing the trails. We saw people of all ages going the trails.
The first is a trail to the Brink of the Lower Falls - this takes you right to the top of the Falls where it comes down. Amazing view to see such enormous volume to water gushing down the canyon. From here, you can either walk down to the next trail (this walk is a trail in itself), or drive to the next stop. Here, there’s a Grand View (right at the entrance of the trail - view is ok, not great). From here there’s a Red Rock trail going down. This is probably the best trail on the North Rim, pretty good views of the Canyon.
All in all, doing the South and North Rim with the hikes should take around two hours, maybe slightly longer depending on your hiking speed and the time you spend at the viewing platforms."

It takes an hour or so to reach from Tower-Roosevelt because the road is winding and the speed limit generally 35 MPH. We didn’t see any wildlife on the road there, but we already had our fill in the Lamar Valley. We reached Canyon Village and then passed the entrance to the North Rim drive (which was jammed with cars) and kept going a few miles to the South Rim drive. At the end of the road is a lookout called Artist Point. Less cars and a large parking lot so it was easier to reach. There were probably 150 people at the lookout and the views were spectacular.

We went in early August and it was hot. If you take it to the bottom, be prepared for the steep uphill climb. I’m in great physical shape but was panting on the uphill because of the altitude. Definitely not recommended for small children or elderly folks we saw too many small children crying and parents who had to make the climb carrying children...in 90 degree heat. In my opinion, children under 8 won’t be able to appreciate it anyway so just stay at the top and have an enjoyable day. For everyone else, the strenuous climb is well worth it. There are viewing outlooks in several places that make for great pictures, but you must wait your turn because of the crowds. As long as you aren’t in a hurry, it is an amazing sight to see."

What a wonderful adventure! The first day we drove in from Cody, Wyoming, toured part of the park and then stayed the next three nights in West Yellowstone. The first day in the park we had our maps and we were getting lost. That night I thought there should be a better way to see Yellowstone. I found a GyPSy guide app and installed it on my phone. It needs to downloaded BEFORE you go to the park. This app was wonderful! It was like having our own tour guide. This app made a HUGE difference in our trip. The app is only $9.99 for Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. We found our trip to be much more relaxing and educational. We visited Yellowstone Grand Canyon the first day and could not find a parking space. One of the parking lots was closed down. The front clerk at the hotel told us to leave for the park before 6:30 and we will get through before the crowd. What a difference it made for us! We went to Yellowstone Grand Canyon and had no crowds. We took a trail down close to the bottom. It is so beautiful!"

It may a disappointment, a 'this is what I expected' or a WOW experience when you do see it. This one is for sure a WOW!
To start with a less positive thing: you need to drive a long time (we entered via the West entrance) to get here. If there are queues on the road (in case animals walk close to or on the road), you easily need 1:30-2:00 to get here. The views are very impressive, viewpoints can be reached by car, often combined with short trails (typically < 0.5 mile)
I read in some comments a comparison with the Grand Canyon. It is a totally different type of canyon, the advantage of this one is that it is smaller and you can have a better total picture and can see the river and waterfalls.
Apart from the awesome views, you can also walk to the upper and lower falls. A lot of trails were closed at the lower falls though since they were rebuilding some sections. Good they do this, but unfortunate if you intended to hike in that area.
Apart from the viewpoints where you can see a big section of the canyon, I like the fact that you can walk till the section where the water dives of the upper falls."

Start at Artists Point. Unfortunately, Inspiration Point, Uncle Tom’s Trail, and the North Rim trails all are closed for the year due to construction. BUT we did a fabulous hike to Sublime Point (same parking lot as Artists Point) which was not very crowded and had beautiful (if close to the edge) views. We also did a back country hike from a fork in the same trail to Ribbon Lake - end was a little anti climatic and trail was buggy. You can skip those two miles but do the one miler (round trip) to Sublime Point for sure. Get there early because this lot is a traffic jam in the summer by 10am, or after 5."

I think this area is second only to the geysers in Yellowstone. It's a don't miss. Because of the name one's tempted to compare it with The Grand Canyon in Arizona-- they are similar only in that they are both canyons with a river. The falls are high and you can get very close. There's an area that you can descend steep stairs to the river. Even if you are in good shape remember you're at 8000' and it may be a struggle. But if you can make it without a lot of pain it's definitely spectacular."

We chose the North Rim Drive and stopped at the Lookout Point and Grand View. Get there ahead of the crowds and enjoy the beauty. The waterfall is incredible.

There are several trails that you can go on for different places along the rim of the canyon.

If you want to be there at the best times, go early in the morning before the tour buses and most of the people crowd up the area, or in the early evening when it gets a bit cooler.
There can be deerflies/horseflies and mosquitoes so be sure to take some insect repellent to keep them at bay. It can be very hot and sunny so be sure to wear sunscreen and appropriate head covering."

It's not as if you have a lot of options for parking down the street and walking. Just drive around the circle until someone leaves and you can take their place. The good news is, if you have someone in your party that has mobility issues, you can take this slowly and get there to see the falls. Don't try to use a walker - use a cane. It's a stunning sight, an amazing, powerful waterfall.

It's a pleasant walk from the parking lot to the viewpoint, not to mention a great opportunity to stretch your legs after all the driving. The view is amazing.
If you're photographically minded, this is very similar to the other Grand Canyon in that the canyon itself is rather wide with the water (details) being a bit distant. The difference is that here you'll likely want to capture some of those distant details. The viewpoint is a bit small so you'll have to work around the other spectators.
Plan on spending 45-90 minutes here."

Yellowstone has many wonderful attractions including the Grand Canyon. There are many warning signs throughout the parking about the dangers of animals and hot springs, HOWEVER there are few warning signs about other dangers. For example, the view of the falls from the southern rim has NO signs warning of the danger that exists from this viewpoint. They simply have some boulders about 2 feet high separating the visitors from the edge of the cliff. I personally saved a small boy that was climbing on them and came close to going over the edge, and who's parents weren't watching him. The loop road that goes through the park is very narrow in most places AND there are many, many miles of it in which there are no guardrails making it very treacherous and nerve racking driving. Sooo, if you don't like mountain driving you might want to think about taking a tour. The drive to this area from Tower Roosevelt is the worst, climbing very high up through the mountains. There are some guardrails but not near enough. Going south you are in the inside lane as you climb, but if you return this way, you will be in the outside lane and there are NO guardrails and there are steep drop-offs. The edge of the road is very close to the drop off. I am very disappointed by the management of this park. The roads should have been widened long ago AND many guardrails added. They focus so much on the dangers of animals that they forget about the other dangers that exist in the park for which nothing is being done. Parking in viewing areas is also very bad. There are millions of trees in the park and the park service is so bent on preserving the park, that they are stingy in chopping down a few trees to add more parking space, which I think is just ridiculous. While Yellowstone is a beautiful park, it definitely needs better management."

It is a steep walk back but you can take breaks along the way.
Lookout point enables you to get good photos from the top of the canyon without walking down into the canyon - look out for the osprey nest in one of the high rocks as you look into the canyon."

There may be others but the overlook we stopped at, had wonderful expansive views of the falls as well as the canyon walls carved out by the river. As I will suggest in any review of major park attractions, get there early since if the road to get there is open, its tourist season.

The place is very crowded daily in the Summer so keep patient with the traffic jams that are experienced so frequently. The weather is also subject to change dramatically, as the rain came quickly and changed an 80 degree day into the fifties, with hail, thunder, and lightning within minutes!
There are two distinct areas to visit, the lower canyon view and the upper ""ledge"" walkway. The lower view provides spectacular views of both the Upper and the Lower Falls. You can walk part of the way onto the lookouts. In August of 2017 the other walkway was closed for the Summer due to construction.
The walk on the Upper Canyon road is the most spectacular since you can walk within feet of the Falls, as you watch the rushing water pass by only a few feet from you, just before the water tumbles down the very high Falls. This is possible only after a somewhat strenuous walk down many stone, wet stairs to the small balcony at the top of the Falls. On the ridge walkway you can see down over the deep cliffs into the Canyon's bottom below, and still get views of the Falls and other beautiful scenery. This area is a must-see for your visit to YNP."

However, my favorite view of the lower falls is from Red Rock Lookout. It does involve a bit of a hike down into the canyon on a well done trail. It is well worth the effort. If you are more ambitious, you can hike lower into the canyon and closer to the lower falls by hiking Uncle Tom's Trail. Also fine views. It is hard to go wrong at any of the canyon viewpoints. Note the canyon is great in any season, although in the winter or spring - snow can limit access."

There are 2 main drives:
1) North Rim Drive: Brink of Upper Falls Trail, Brink of Lower Falls Trail, Inspiration Point, Red Rock Point, Lookout Point, Grand View Point
2) South Rim Drive: Artist Point, Uncle Tom's Trail (closed until Fall 2019)
Hikers can opt to do the North Rim Trail (partially closed between Brink of Lower Falls Trail and Brink of Upper Falls Trail until Fall 2019) and South Rim Trail (closed until Fall 2019) instead of the drives.
My husband and I visited in August. As hikers, we were disappointed that we could not hike the South Rim Trail, including Uncle Tom's Trail, which takes you to the base of Lower Falls. However, we understand the importance of maintaining this natural beauty and hope to return when construction is completed. We did the North Rim Drive around 6pm on Saturday and the South Rim Drive around noon on Sunday. We recommend doing the drives either early or later in the day as there is limited parking. We had no trouble finding parking at the various view points on North Rim Drive at 6pm but had to park on the side of the road instead of the designated parking lot at Artist Point.
The Brink of Upper Falls Trail and Brink of Lower Falls Trail are 0.4 mi/0.6 km each and really do take you to the brink of the falls. While all the viewpoints were pretty, Artist Point was the most scenic and memorable. If you have time for only 1 viewpoint in Yellowstone, make it Artist Point."

There are two drives/trails to do: one is the North Rim Drive, and the other is the South Rim Drive. You just have to do both !!! You will get fantastic views, up close and personal, of the Upper Falls, the Lower Falls and of course the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, as you walk along the rim of each side of the canyon.
Make sure you the do Brink of the Upper Falls lookout, and the Brink of the Lower Falls viewpoint, be sure to do Lookout Point, Grand View...all on the North Rim. Then make sure you do the Upper Falls view, Uncle Tom's Point, Uncle Tom's Trail, and Artist Point...all on the South Rim.
Truly an incredibly wondrous creation !!!
Either go to Yellowstone NP in the Spring, before Memorial Day weekend, or in the early fall, after Labor Day weekend...if your schedule allows. You will avoid the huge tourist crowds, congestion, noise, and all that goes along with the summer crush !!! We went the first full week after Labor Day weekend, and the crowds were GONE. Easy to park, no congestion, in some places hardly any people, saw a lot of wildlife as they were content to come back into view now that the people had left. But be sure to bring layers of clothes, as temps can be comfortable during the day, but can be quite cold in the evening. We even experienced snow and freezing temps a couple of our days visiting !!!
Take lots of photos...Enjoy !!!"

There were several stops along the way for rest room and snack breaks and the tour price does include a box lunch.

Our pictures bring back fond memories we will always treasure. Having been to Yellowstone the last 2 Christmas vacation, the Canyon Day Tour is my favorite and I would strongly recommend it. Please note that our day was sunny, about 8 degrees, and gorgeous blue sky."

Parking was still available and the temperature was still on the cool side. There are several stops on each side of the canyon, some are closed for construction (Inspiration Point, part of the north rim trail, and Uncle Tom's Point). We stopped at Artist Point, Brink of the Upper Falls, Lower Falls, Lookout Point, and Grand View. My favorite was Artist Point, the views are excellent from here. Parking lots at most of the spots are big enough for several cars. Most of the sites are within easy walking from the parking lots. The only exception is Brink of the Lower Falls, the trail drops steeply about 600 feet to the falls. Some reviews compare this to the Grand Canyon in Arizona, but there is no comparison. This is unique and beautiful in its own way. This is a must stop when visiting the park. If you can only see one part of the canyon, I recommend Artist Point. I also recommend arriving early to avoid the major crowds."

If there is snow, just be prepared for slippery conditions on the switchbacks until the snow and slush is gone.

This is for good reason. The views of the canyon are simply amazing, and there is nothing else like it. The Yellowstone River, combined with unique volcanic activity, has created a very interesting canyon with rock formations and colors that are unlike anything else I've seen.
There are roads that go along the upper rim and part of the lower rim. There's plenty of parking on the upper rim, so you can stop at various places to walk and take pictures. I recommend hiking down to the brink of the lower falls and lookout point.
Construction at the time prevented us from reaching Inspiration Point, but it likely had a similar view to the other locations we did see.
Bottom line: Be sure to check out the Grand Canyon when in Yellowstone."

If you want to see it from a different perspective, you can do a very steep, but fair short hike to the top of the lower falls (take lower falls trail from north rim drive). It's important to note these two different views are on opposite sides of the Canyon - chittenden bridge will take you over the river."

It is absolutely incredible that there is such diversity in this park and a canyon is just one of many.
The parking lot is big so plenty of room. It was pouring with rain the day we visited but the place was still packed with tourists. The main viewing area, like many in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, was CROWDED so you had to wait to get a good picture etc.
Easy walk from the parking lot to viewing areas and of course the Falls can be seen here too. Glad we saw it but we were wowed more by some of the other sights."

We started at Artists Point on the south side. I'd recommend getting there early (8 am or so) because the light is great for photos and the crowds are not there yet. When we visited, the rest of the So. Rim Drive stops (Uncle Tom's, So. Rim trail) were closed for renovation which I believe will continue into 2018) so check with the park website on their status if they are important to your visit.
We then drove to the North Rim. We did the four outlook hikes:
The Lower Falls hike is worth doing and while there are a few switch backs it is not overly strenuous
Look outpoint is an easy walk to the edge of the canyon with great views of the falls.
The Red Rock hike is strenuous, with lots of stairs and switch backs but the view and photos you can get of the falls are worth the work. I highly recommend this hike.
the Grand view trail is a short easy walk to the edge, again great views of the canyon
As of Sept 2017, the Inspiration Point Rd and trail were closed for renovations. Check with the park website on when it will reopen in 2018.
Note: most but not all of the restrooms are pit toilets, if that is an issue Brink of the Lower Falls overlook has regular restrooms
Be sure and see the canyon while you are in Yellowstone."

Strangely I haven't heard of this canyon prior to visiting Yellowstone but with the combination of a beautiful talls falls (twice the height of Niagara Falls), pine forest, and canyon, this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen and it was entirely created by nature and preserved by the national park service.
There is a north rim and south rim. The road goes fairly close to multiple sites on both rims. You can hike around both rims (short distance). You can't hike down to the canyon. If you want to see the river, go upstream to the Yellowstone lake or downstream to the hike by Tower Falls or much later driving north out of Yellowstone on highway 89."

Before a visit you really have to do some research. The ideal is to stay in the park, which takes a year of lead time or guts and luck. We are always impressed at the quality and service provided by the NPS. Our nation does some things well.
I think it's important to plan the spots you really want to see. Plan on picnics and several hikes. Without planning you will spend too much time in a car. Our favorite was the canyon at the upper and lower falls. Truly amazing, it explains why the park is named Yellowstone.
With no reservations, we found cancellations at several of the prime resorts. That's the guts and luck part. If you find nothing, your forced to stay at one of the fringe towns outside the parks entrance. This option increases your drive time and many of the accommodations are also filled during the summer season. Not the easiest NP to enjoy but well worth the effort."

The Falls are breathtaking, and totally worth the hike.

But don't skip them! They're among the most beautiful, inspiring sites in the park. Get there early- like 7:00 a.m. early- to have your pick of parking spots, photo ops and trails. Morning 'Must See's' open now on the South Rim: 1) entire Artist's Point viewing area, all 3 levels offer different views 2) a walk of any length on the trail to Point Sublime (many points along this path that we label 'Point Good Enough' if not enough time to do the entire trail!) Afternoon/Evening Must See's open on the North Rim are: 1) Upper Falls Overlook and 2) Inspiration Point. If you go when everything is open again, visit everything on the map on both rims- you won't regret it. Spend the night, go to the North Rim during afternoon/evening and do the South Rim in the morning for the best light for photos. Opinions vary on this, but we've been coming here since the 70's & our pictures tell the story."

There are different points to view it from, but Artist Point is an absolute must if you want to get the shot on all the postcards. Get there early, like before 9am, if you want to make it easy to find a parking space. Also, it put's the morning light on the falls for a better picture. There's a chance of a rainbow, too, around 9:30-10am, over the falls. There are basically 3 drives with stops you need to make to see the canyon area, all very close to each other. One is South Rim Drive, which includes Uncle Tom's Trail (currently closed for repairs) and Artist Point. The next is Brink of the Upper Falls. The third is North Rim Drive, which includes Lookout Point, Grand View, and Inspiration Point (also currently closed).

Go early; it gets very crowded at the pull offs later in the day. Walk around and experience the beauty and majesty from various vantage points and various trails.

I consider this a ""must stop"" point. You can park at several different places along the way as you get to see and appreciate the magnificence of the canyon. In peak hours day during summer time it can be challenging to find a spot as parking is limited but if you are patient you always find one. The stop is not long (stop, go take a look, take pictures.. admire the place.. then off to the next) so there is always someone leaving every few minutes. We personally found that the best times are before 10 am and after 4 pm, and you also get the benefit of not catching the heat as much either if you come early (and is summer time). You can (of course) drive there at any time but expect crowds between 10 am & 4 pm so patience is key. Remember to park in designated areas as Park Rangers and Patrols are always around."

It is common to have long delays for animals wandering on the highway or road work. The pullouts for attractions are always full and crowded, parking can be a challenge, especially for large vehicles pulling travel trailers and motor homes. The traffic in the park is starting to overwhelm the parks ability to accommodate it. Some of the heavily traveled trails around the attractions are in disrepair. Yellowstone is where cultures collide. Be ready to encounter bus loads of foreign visitors that don't have time to respect your space, their goal is to quickly get their pictures and get back to the bus.

It's not as large as its cousin to the south, but is just as spectacular.
Its much less crowded than other attractions at Yellowstone, but shouldn't be missed.
If you want to take a little hike, there is a nice trail from near the Canyon Lodge that leads to the lookout for the canyon."

It is very accessible, you can drive either the North or South rim road. It is very easy to pull off and walk back a little bit and take some pictures. We visited both rims. You get different views of the waterfalls from each rim. Our favorite was ""Artist's Point"" at the South Rim. There is a fabulous view of the waterfall from there. We had a perfect day with beautiful blue skies above which contrasted just right with the earthy tones of the canyon. Just stunning."

- walk along the various paths to get different perspectives of Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone
- leave the selfie sticks in the car... they're annoying!"

Be prepared for Disney sized crowds. The viewing area is just a short ~100 meter walk from the parking lot which is crowded requiring us to ‘spin for a spot’ around the parking to a few times to secure an open parking spot. There is a walking trail that extends out of the main viewing area that is a leisurely walk with magnificent views. I figure less than 10% of overall visitors walk this trail so it’s a wonderful opportunity to see the sights away from the masses.
The views from both sides of the canyon are simply unforgettable!"

Except for the Artists Point, Brink of Upper Falls and Grand View, the rest requires a long and relatively challenging hikes, especially the Brink of Lower Falls; however, each one is a must see!
The Sublime Point, in my humble opinion is over rated. Reaching the end of the .5 mile rugged trail and seeing the view made me exclaim ""That' it?"". Along the trail from Artists to Sublime Point, there are several pleasantly overwhelming view angles of the canyon and Yellowstone River.
Despite the fact that Uncle Tom's Trail is under maintenance and, therefore, closed, our number of steps for the day exceeded 17,000. We hiked to the Red Rock Point on another day.

My wife and I saw all the attractions we wanted to with out the crowds by going early parking & then hitting the hiking trails before the crowds arrived.
we would get back to parking spots ready to leave to find big crowds and long lines of people waiting to find parking ... I said to myself that I would not being having any fun if that was the way I spent my vacation....

Hiked from there along the South rim Trail to Uncle Tom's Trail---Then down the stairs to the lookout point---up close and personal with the falls. Very tough down and back up hundreds of steep stairs and back to the parking lot. Went over to the North Rim for trails of the Brink of Upper Falls and Brink of Lower Falls----then on to the North Rim trail through Red Rock (once again very steep down and back up)---then Lookout---Grand View--all giving a different perspective to the falls. Approx. 10 miles total that gave numerous vantage points for view of the falls--even saw Ospreys in a huge nest at top of a rock formation. Start early as these trails get crowded later on----Parking in this area is a challenge--we found it easier to park once on each Rim---and hike all the trails on that side then back to the car. Carry plenty of water and snacks if you choose to combine trails into longer hikes. It limits the need to keep returning to the car for supplies and finding new parking spots.
Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is a very appropriate name---worth spending an entire day there!!"

We visited the lower Falls side only. This was one of the more crowded places in the park but it was early afternoon so that was expected. If you only have 1 day in the park add this to your list. There is a short hike down to the falls which I was able to do in sandals. My kids raced back up but they are in great shape- may be tough for elderly. There are some places to take a break though."

The canyon is one of the must-see places. It has many pull-offs along the way. Uncle Tom's was closed so it was extra crowded at Artist's Point. Brave the traffic jam and you will be rewarded. Parking gets really congested. The earlier you can go, the better. Also, include the scenic drive on your trip. It's worth it. Then stop for a bite at Canyon Lodge. The scenic drive ends next to the entrance."

The trail between Wapati Lake and Uncle Tom's Trail is closed. Uncle Tom's Trail is also closed. The car wait to get to Artist Point was at least 30 points, due to high summer traffic. With limited cell phone coverage, it was a bit of a big problem, as signage was very limited as to the closures. Having dropped off our group before taking our cars, we found that the trail was closed, resulted in our party being separated.
In the end, we returned on another day, earlier in the morning before the traffic going to Artist Point was so backed up. (We were trying to do this about 11 am on June 30). The ranger later told us that between 9 and 5, the road to Artist Point is at least 30 minute backup.
The view is truly spectacular and iconic, so you cannot dismiss it. My best advice, based on other travelers would be to park at Wapati Lake - take the trail to Wapati Lake, then cut over to Uncle Tom's Trail. Find the trail to Artist Point ( the lower 1 mile is open). Unfortunately, you would then need to send someone back (2 miles+) to get a car and wait in line to pick up others.
Ironically, when we did visit the Northern Rim on July 3, there were people on Uncle Tom's Trail and the stairway down to view the Upper Falls. Not sure if it had suddenly opened or more likely - groups were dismissing the ""closed"" signs."

One thing that I really would like to raise a flag was the look out places were not 100% safe for toddlers or younger kids.
The fence was made for adults' design (small kids may be able to sneak inside and may have a chance to fall off); So adults should hold hands tightly and take very good care of young ones.
The views were gorgeous - people may be confused by the name of Grand Canyon, which is totally different look- but Yellowstone's Grand Canyon is namely Grand Canyon, which offers different charms.
Upper falls' lookout was easy as it's only 0.3mile walk from the parking lot but lower falls could show great landscape.
Highly recommend to see both ones for differences."

We also took the hike down to the brink of the lower falls. I would not recommend this for anyone with walking difficulties or health issues. There are quite a few switchbacks and the uphill can be long and difficult. But you get right next to the falls and is totally worth it!!!

It gets so busy during July and August. Artist point is a precarious hike that parallels the canyon until you get to a set of wooden steps that lead you to the bottom of the falls. Not a great hike for young kids. We also did the Lower Falls hike. It's steep and long but worth it. It takes you to the top of the Falls. There are breathtaking views. There are lots of benches along the hike so you can rest. We were a group of 5 from the ages of 12-65. Loved it. We also checked out the canyon visitor center.

This area seems to be the most popular in Yellowstone aside from Old Faithful but with about 1/3 the parking - so plan accordingly.
We could see people across on North Rim as well - so either way works. We went South Rim because of the easy access to Uncle Tom's Point to overlook the upper falls - then off to Artist Point to overlook the lower falls. A mile long hike beyond took us to Point Sublime and a fantastic overlook with 10% of the crowds. People tend not to venture too far beyond the main areas.
To go down into the Canyon area vs. look from the top - there are a lot of stairs - yet this isn't necessary to get the grandeur.
To see both stops and take the trails - allow at least 2 hours; probably 3"

There are plenty of access points with good views, however, if you can get away from the crowds on one of the many trails you will be rewarded with truly fantastic views. We walked both the South Rim and the trail to Point Sublime and the views just got better and better. If you intend to visit the park you must include a visit to the Canyon. It is well worth stopping at Canyon Village and the Educational Centre where rangers can give you up to date info on the various trails. You will find their advice very helpful."

Everything was jammed packed with cars and bus-loads of tourists. Most of the park was un-visitable because of this, or when a parking lot wasn't full/closed, the trail or site was stuffed with throngs of people.
This was one of the first sites you come upon if you take the road that loops to the right when you come in. I would have stayed to see it even if there were thirty busses filled with tourists. It is striking and the best thing in the park, in my opinion, unless you get to go off the beaten path and stay (camp out) inside the park away from the crowds,"

You can start from the Canyon Village's Canyon Visitor Education Center.
It is fascinating that Yellowstone NP also has its own 'Grand Canyon'.
As the first and very popular National Park established in USA since 1872, Yellowstone does get very crowded during summer time.
More than 4 million visitors admire and experience the Yellowstone National Park, annually.
Hot water acting on volcanic rock created the canyon's colors.
There is a few minutes walk to get to the view point which is well worth it for the magnificent views and sublime picture-taking.
Lookout Point has a vista of Lower Falls (308 feet) and walkways along the canyon's rims.
Grand view gives spectacular views of the canyon.

You can see all the colors throughout the canyon, the powerful river below (with steam in some places), and the Lower Falls which super powerful, even when you don't get to walk up close.
There was an osprey nest on one of the rock spires that looked huge and you could see two osprey chilling. I've read they keep reusing the same nest for years, so I can imagine how long it took to build up to that size.
When we went there was mild snow falling, and there was a rainbow across the Lower Falls. Definitely worth a stop at each of the viewpoints.
Logistically, we entered from the town of Canyon to the North Rim one way road. There are several places along the road to stop and walk a short distance to an overlook or vista - or you can park and walk along the North Rim Trail, which walks along them, too."

There are 4 view points to enjoy the magnificent site. 2 of the points are on the rim and are accessible for strollers and where chairs.

You can hear the roar of the waterfalls and there is a good view of the falls itself.
It will take almost one full day to enjoy the beauty from all view points. The best time of the year is June-July or Oct-Nov time frame when the temperature above 50-60 degrees.

Do you need to see God's glory in His creation? Do you need to be near the natural art left behind by the forces of nature? Look no further. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is a natural wonder that changes lives every day. It is that special.
It is not to be missed during a visit to Yellowstone; especially if it is a once in a lifetime visit for you. Take your time. There are some great hikes at this canyon one might miss, if not made aware. Uncle Tom's Trail will get you a great vantage point of the Lower Falls. Red Rock Point is a trail accessed from Lookout Point. You can get a more direct, straight on view of the Falls from Red Rock Point. It's worth the hike. Both hikes are not too long. But both are steep.
Uncle Tom's Trail has an abundance of steps to conquer. Red Rock trail is steep, but no steps. Have fun!"

When you visit Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, you can enjoyed not only the beautiful colors of the canyon and its magnificent height but also marvelous sights of the Lower, Upper, and Crystal Falls.
There are numerous views of the Falls and Grand Canyon from both the north and south sides of the Grand Canyon, most of which require only a short walk or virtually no walk to see. However, this is one of the most famous spots at the park so during the peak times of the day, it may be hard to find a parking space. It's always wiser to start the day early for the most famous areas of the park or visit them later in the day.
- From the north side of the canyon: Using the North Rim Drive, you can stop and view the Lower Falls and Grand Canyon of Yellowstone at Inspiration Point, Grand View Point, and Lookout Point. On this side, you can also journey to the top of the falls and feel its extreme power, commanding respect, and intense roar as it drops into the rainbow of mist beneath by hiking down the Brink of the Lower Falls Trail. This is a short 3/4 mile hike but intense with great drop in elevation and a lot of switch backs.
- From the south side of canyon: Using the South Rim Drive, you can stop and view the Lower Falls and Grand Canyon of Yellowstone at Artists Point. Artists Point is where you can have the most beautiful grand view of the Lower Falls together with Grand Canyon of Yellowstone and the snaking Yellowstone River below. On this side, you can also journey down the Uncle Tom's Trail to have a close-up face off with the electrifying Lower Falls."

Perfect for nature-lovers, national park aficionados, photographers, artists, writers, sightseers, basic tourists, and those who have seen it all. Every perspective is a masterpiece to inspire an artist and to awe any viewer. No wait is needed to see this like Old Faithful, no large crowds at one spot like other geysers, and no need to move around to feel like you have fully experienced it as this canyon feels like every single location is a new experience. The falls, the river, the hikes (both the strenuous and easy ones), and everything in between were some of the best experiences of my life. Even the large stairway to get to the falls isn't enough to hinder my opinion on this wonder of the world."

There's 10 switchbacks on the trail that bring you down 800 feet in altitude to reach the top of the lower falls and the magnificent views of the canyon. Don't think about the hike back up. Just know that the views at the bottom are so worth it.
This is one of the highlights of Yellowstone, yet one that can be easily missed by those who don't realize how spectacular the Yellowstone River canyon is."

Be prepared for a long wait to get into the park if you are visiting in the busy months of July / August. I think we were lined up outside of the park for about 30 mins just trying to get in. This was in the South Entrance. We first went to the West Thumb area where we saw 6 female elks lazing in the grass. There is a walk here which is about 800 meters around the various types of Geysers. Also stop at the Volcano Mud Pools which is pretty interesting. Here we got up close with some Bison that were sunbathing on the path. Then stopped at the Lower and Upper Falls. Not far from here is the ""Grand Canyon of Yellowstone"" which is a large canyon filled with beautiful reds, oranges and browns in colour. Head to Norris Geyser Basin which is a 1.6km round trip with lots of colourful Geysers to look at. Gibbon Falls is a great waterfall if you just want a good view from the parking lot. The Middle Geyser Basin is home to the famous Grand Prismatic Geyser - this is the colourful one always used in the brochures. It is extremely impressive but if the weather is bad or windy you won't see too much. We had a lot of steam and wind and really couldn't see too much. We had to wait for a break in the wind before we saw the colours.
One thing to note is that the parking in the park in summer is ridiculous. There are not enough car park spaces for the large amount of tourists especially in summer so you will end up parked on the side of the road and walk in. Be mindful do not park in spaces that say no parking. We did see people checking parked cars and writing out tickets.
Overall the park is just amazing. It is mostly all about wildlife and geysers so if you like them then you will have a blast. Try and go in either May or late August early September to avoid the traffic madness."

We hiked both the Lower Falls Brink Trail (3/8 mi. and 600 foot drop) and the Uncle Tom's Trail (328 steps down in the canyon for a beautiful view of the Lower Falls), and although both trails were steep, they were both worth it! We also stayed at the new Canyon Hotel, and everything was brand new and lovely. We walked over to the cafeteria for breakfast, which was nice because it was quick, cheap, and had good options. We liked staying in the Canyon Area because of it's central location ... we would stay here again. We liked that it was less crowded than either the Old Faithful or Mammoth areas, and yet we could easily drive to both locations."

My family and friends took part in the Yellowstone Lower Loop full day tour, stopping at many attractions. On the tour, we went to Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Grand Prismatic Spring, and Firehole Canyon. Yellowstone opened my eyes to how beautiful the natural world is.
One of the places we went was the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The tour bus stopped at the entrance, so we could hike to the canyon. Our tour guide informed us about the area of Yellowstone and the wildlife it contained. On the journey to the canyon, I saw lots of wildlife I hadn’t seen before. The wild animals were ginormous and fascinating. The canyon was astonishing. Canyons and mountains surrounded a giant waterfall and a blue river. Looking around, I saw the most beautiful picture of the earth and wildlife engulfing me. Until I went to the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, I never realized how big the world was compared to the small town I live in.
In Yellowstone, the tour took us to the Grand Prismatic Spring. The hike to the spring was enjoyable because there were small hot springs all around that you could look into. It was important to stay on the path so we didn’t disturb wildlife or accidentally step in a boiling spring. After being amazed by the hot springs on the way, my mind was blown when I finally reached Grand Prismatic. In order to get a view of the entire spring, we had to climb a hill that looks onto it. The vibrant colors of Grand Prismatic make it a must see. Blue, red, orange, and pink filled the steaming water below us. Grand Prismatic is the most fascinating sight I have ever seen. I had no idea the world contained such breathtaking features.
The excursion to Firehole Canyon was my favorite adventure during the Yellowstone tour. Firehole Canyon is a beautiful canyon connected to the Firehole River. Part of the canyon consisted of still, warm water that we got to relax in. The water was the perfect temperature for swimming because the river is connected to various hot springs in Yellowstone. It was very peaceful relaxing on the rocks in the water and looking around at the beautiful cliffs and mountains surrounding me. Firehole Canyon also has an area with cliffs and rapids. It was exhilarating to jump off of the cliffs and into the rapids. My friends and I spent hours flinging ourselves into the fast-moving rapids. We had a lot of fun at Firehole Canyon, while still enjoying beautiful scenery.
Yellowstone National Park opened my eyes to a world outside of the city. I recommend going on the Yellowstone tour to enjoy beautiful scenery and wildlife. The tour provided lots of information and fun as we traveled through the park. Taking part in the Yellowstone tour allowed to me to experience and see sights that were once unknown to me."

I didn't know there was one in Yellowstone. When I reached around 4pm. Damn, was I delightfully surprised. You could hear the roar of the tall waterfall. I think there was a path to go near it, but I didn't go down. I stayed on the safer and higher side of the canyon.
The path were well-paved, it ain't muddy nor rocky, quite feet-friendly, most of the path were wheelchair friendly too. Looking across the canyon was nothing very spectacular. The best part was looking down into the canyon. The sunlight, on that day, was bright and brought out the contrast of the rugged surface of the cliffs. The colours of the canyon walls and the blue water of the river was beautiful without photoshop.
I believe the trek can go on and on and on, I didn't venture too far. I do see there are people across the canyon on the other side. So, you probably could spend a good half a day if you are into photography. If not, just 40min - 1hr is a pretty comfortable time.
Oh, we got a bonus to see a hawk chasing off a raven which flew too near to its nest."

There is so much great hiking around the rim offering breathtaking views. Some of the trails were closed for the season by the time we got there in mid september, but there were so many other trails open, it didn't matter.
If you are going to hike (and I mean really hike, not stopping where the sidewalk ends) the trails, just like everywhere in Yellowstone, be prepared! Have water and bear spray. Try to go in groups and talk loudly to scare off any bears or other wildlife that may be near by. While we didn't see any bears, we saw plenty of things that let us know they were nearby (... big piles of fresh poo...). I don't say that to scare anyone off from hiking. Just be prepared so you can enjoy it!
The steps down to the waterfall are hard, but so worth it! Please seriously consider if you think you are up for it. I am pretty fit and still had to stop coming back up. There are benches in different spots along the way for you to stop and rest. Also consider if you are ok with open heights. The steps are see through and can be a little unnerving if you don't like heights.
There was a good amount of parking. But again, we were there mid September. I've heard horror stories about the summer."

This is a fabulous area. This was our 3rd trip to Yellowstone & we came here all 3 times.
Canyons is a very busy place. I would recommend the same advice I give to everyone : when visiting a busy national park GET UP EARLY!! Shower the night before. Eat a light breakfast (not in a restaurant) & get over there!! In the summer this place is jump'in.
There are 2 main areas. The North Rim & South Rim. Both are equally beautiful, but due to construction, we've spent more time at the South Rim. The parking area in the South Rim is huge. The view of the Lower Falls spectacular. There's a few day hikes you can access at this point. The Canyon Rim South Trail is 3.5 miles one way, but fantastic views can be seen at many points on the trail. Walk a little way & then go back when you get tired.
The North Rim parking is a problem. If you go later in the day, you will have stress. This road is one way traffic only. Inspiration Point is a highlight. There's also the North Rim Trail, which is 3 miles one way. There's also a lot of great views.
Canyons has a large shopping area, with restaurants, the General Store, an outdoor outfitter & the Visitor Center. There's also a campground with laundry & showers."

The bare rocks of the Yellowstone ""grand"" Canyon are truly golden yellow, (and in places even tangerine orange and russet red), hence ""Yellow stone"". We walked to a viewpoint along the Uncle Tom's Cabin Trail, and could see the Yellowstone River clearly as it pelted over a steep precipice and into the gorge below. We followed the trail down a winding track, the air scented with pine resin, almost to the base of the falls. After a mile or so, the path stopped abruptly, 380 steps on several steel connected platforms took us to the valley floor, where the spray creates misty rainbows.

When you step out to see the canyon it is Oh so Yellow, and Oh so vast !
there are steps down in places for a better view if the waterfall. Not to be missed. On a cautious note the barrier is quite low in places."

Hint1: There are many locations to view the canyon. Visit them all. They give completely different views. It is truly amazing.
Hint2: Don't worry about the crowds. There are many areas with easy access and fences that tend to be a bit crowded, but people move on and you will get to the front to see the views.
Hint3: To avoid the crowds, hit the paths. There are many uncrowded paths where you can walk right up to the edge of a cliff and look down without any fence or barrier. Everywhere you go and look, the views are unbelievable.
Hint4: Take a ton of pictures, but don’t expect them to replicate the beauty and depth of the canyon. Looking at the photos and videos I took, the videos do a much better job of capturing the depth, color and size of the area."

One time for myself and twice more as a family guide. I enjoyed Yellowstone more than Yosemite, Grand Canyon or even Rocky Mountain although they have less visitors. Might be due to it's location. Simply driving thru the ""number 8"" shape scenic loop gave me lot of fun. It's a huge park. All three times I visited, I entered the park at 8am and finished the complete loop at around 6 or 7pm depends on the traffic. I took almost all small roads where car can enter thru. I like this park because I don't have to walk too far too see things. So it's great place like myself who hates walking too much during the vacation (I take vacation to relax). Most of the viewing can be done from inside the car or by very short walk. Be forewarn that this park has lot of Park Ranger action compare to other parks. I never seen so many visitors get pulled over(assuming speeding) like in this park. They come out from nowhere like the highway patrols. If you're there for just one day, then do the counter-clock drive. It's a better side for viewing and entering view points. If you begin before 8am you should be able to view all the popular attractions and finish the ""8"" loop by 7pm. If you're lucky you'll catch Old Faithful eruption as well. At one visit I tried to complete full loop and reverse back loop in one day but couldn't unless I'm the only one in the park, and without speed limit. You will definitely see Bisons but I noticed huge number of them come out on the road just before sunset when most visitors are gone. And lastly, don't make a mistake of not visiting Grand Teton National Park right below the Yellowstone."

Seems that the land just lifts up impressively from the basin to the elevated hill, forming the canyon with Yellowstone river inside and the scenic views as well. It'a wonderful place to view the waterfall from the viewing deck on the top. BTW, Yellowstone River flows to the north and will merge to Madison river in Montana, then join Missouri River and Mississippi River in Missouri.

Yellowstone - Overall, scenery stunning, lots of buffalo & elk (very few 'visible' bears) but HUNDREDS of cars and people.
This is not a wilderness - it's a huge safari park but still enjoyable.

A hike with a drop of 600 feet takes you to the top of the lower falls from this viewpoint, where you can stand on the lip of the lower falls,
The lower falls are by far the more impressive, being the iconic picture of the Yellowstone river.
The lower falls viewpoint gives an excellent view of the lower falls with minimal walking.

Every stop on the road is little or no hiking to a great viewpoint. Off the main road you can choose to take the South loop of North loop. If you only take one take the South loop as it takes in Uncle Tom's Trail and Artist Point. Note the North loop becomes a one way loop that heads into the Canyon Lodge area which is convenient if you are staying there. Do not violate the rules of staying on the trails or viewing viewing area fencing. It is enticing but people have died in these areas that are very safe. Go early to get better vibes and easier picture taking as when the tour buses arrive it sort of disturbs the pleasure a bit. Note that Uncle Tom's trail can scare people because of the alerts of the 358 or so steps can be exhausting, it is not as bad as it sounds, so go ahead it is worth it, just take your time."

The parking isn't as bad here as other places, but because of the tour buses stopping here, the crowds will be bigger. That isn't bad though it will be a multicultural event with everyone asking to have their picture taken with the waterfall and river back ground in all kinds of different languages. Mostly lots of pointing and hand waving trying to communicate with each other. We really had a great time in the crowds and after they dispersed we did some of the hikes and enjoyed getting up and close to some of the water features down in the canyon it self. All we spent more time here than any place else at YNP.
The Good: wonderful views of the canyon with an impressive water fall flowing into a striking blue river.
The Bad: Should have spent more time here than other places in the park
The ugly: Parking can be ""interesting"" in peak crowds
On the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10, I give this canyon 8 bubbles"

Decided to back-track to after heading down to Old Faithful in the morning and we are glad we did. Was well worth the additional time it took.
Watch the signs and be aware that the best views of the ""brink"" of the falls are from the first parking lot you pull in to. We had to circle around the loop twice because we missed the signs that are immediately on the right as you pull in to the upper lot. Once you arrive in the lot there are a lot of overlooks and trails that offer various angles of the canyon and falls. A thorough visit can be accomplished in 1.5 - 2 hours.
Take good shoes and a good camera!"

We came in the north entrance (wonderful stone arch dedicated to Teddy Roosevelt) after staying overnight in Bozeman. BTW, if you are over 65, buy a Senior pass: free admittance to all national parks. You get your $10 back in one visit.
. We wanted to see the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone so we turned east at Mammoth Springs (what wonderful old buildings!). We picked the lower falls - the views are all along the rim. To see the best view of the falls, try the wooden walkway down into the canyon. It is a spectacular canyon! Then we drove over to Norton Basin (stopping for a picnic at the Virginia Cascades - picnic tables at the end of the loop). The Basin has a nice museum and several walks through the geysers. Fascinating!
To leave the park through the east entrance, you drive by the immense Lake Yellowstone. It's a long way to Cody (30 minutes to the East entrance, 50 more to Cody) but the canyon on the way is beautiful.
We came back into the park the next day and left by the south entrance, right into the Tejons NP. Be sure to keep your entry receipt or have that Senior pass ready.
FYI. Gas is available all over the park. Take a picnic so you can skip the Grills and restaurants that are filled by buses. Picnic tables everywhere and in beautiful areas."

It is a short drive south of the Canyon Village & Visitor Center. We went to both the north and south rims - to get a different view of the canyon and the falls. The ""Lookout Point"" on the north rim gives you a closer look at the lower fall. The ""Artist Point"" on the south rim give you a more complete impression of the canyon; it is one of the most popular spots to take pictures. I highly recommend visiting both rims but keep in mind that the north rim road is a one-way road and you will end up going back to the Canyon Village.
You can also take one of the trails to go down to the bottom of the lower fall but there are a lot of stairs to climb; it is not recommended if you don't have much time."

We enjoyed the beauty of this easy stop, however, we did not enjoy the large crowds.

We spent about three hours visiting the different points to view the Upper and Lower Falls. We did not take Uncle Tom's Trail, but stopped at the Brink of the Upper and Lower Falls, Artists Point, and a couple more places along the North Rim Drive. The different views of the falls are spectacular. We especially enjoyed Artists Point and the Brink of the Upper Falls....you are standing directly over the falls and the noise of the rushing water is awesome. My husband in unable to walk long distances or inclines and he was able to walk to both brinks as well as Artists Point without any difficulty."

Once at the bottom there is a nice landing and an awesome view of the lower falls. The upper falls trail is very easy to access and also provides excellent views. A short distance from this access point is a stop called artist point, make sure to see this , all of Yellowstone is breathtaking , it allows you to see the lower falls as it cascades into the steep canyon below .

Depending on where you come in from (either Grand Loop from the south or north, or Norris Canyon Rd. from the west) you will hit either North Rim or South Rim drives first.
The South Rim Drive will take you to Uncle Tom's trail, a short and easily accessible trail that follows along the canyon and to Artist's Point, which is easily one of my favorite sights.
North Rim Drive is a loop from Canyon Village south to Grand Loop Rd near the South Rim Drive and has view access of its own to the brink of both falls and to Inspiration Point (which sadly was closed when we drove through).
Overall it was a great experience (although not very child-friendly) in Yellowstone!"

Views from the North Rim are spectacular. From the rush of water on the Lower Falls, to the mists rising at it hits canyon bottom. The color of the walls, a soft, creamy ecru often shot through with red, to the blue of the river running below. It really is breath taking. I did not make the trek down to the falls viewing platforms but from what I understand it is relatively easy. Check with the rangers to be sure. I did go over to the South Rim.

I recommend the South Rim Trail along the south rim of the canyon for the best overall views -- you get great views of the falls and multiple overlooks of the canyon. You could start at Uncle Tom's Trail and climb down the 380 steps if you want, but the views from the trail were just as good in my opinion and far less busy. The east end of the South Rim Trail is Artist's Overlook (also packed with tourists), so the walk along the way between Uncle's Tom's Trail and Artist's Overlook is probably the best way to get all of the views with less foot traffic around you."

Crowd's anticipation is fully justified & cheering on seeing the Geyser can only be explained as ecstatic. A sprawling Log Cabin(claimed to be largest of its kind in Northern America) serves people with Good Food, lodging & Greatest of the views. A Great Water Fall & Rhyolite mountain takes up your afternoon. You can drive around a number of places stopping by to admire Nature at its Best. We chose to drive back to Jackson for the Night. Setting sun behind the Grand Tetons Range offers magnificent vista to record and savour later with Wine & Dinner. Plan for at least two nights stay, you will not be disappointed. Love to go back."

Just too many people and too many cars. National Parks need to consider queues for viewing points......with say a maximum stay of 20 seconds before you need to move on.

That's where you want to stay if you want to send time visiting the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Take the Upper Rim road and the Lower Rim road. Stop at all the turnouts, because each gives you a different view of the canyon, river and falls. Do some hiking, but be sure to educate yourself about the trails - some have large elevation changes - easy going down, but difficult going back up.

I have seen bears, deer, wolves, otters but on previous visits, this trip we only saw a raven in one of the badly organised car parks.
It is a beautiful place but don't go in July or August is my recommendation. We had a day long traffic jam which is miserable especially when ones expectations (based on previous trips) are so high and hoping to see an abundance of wildlife. There is nothing wrong with Yellowstone but if you wish to watch Old Faithful along with several thousand other folks the go in July or August. Last time I saw Old Faithful I was there in June and saw it blow with maybe one hundred people also watching. Sadly a forgettable experience for us this time around, I will be back but not in July or August, our experience was quite horrid unless you like sitting in heavy traffic on your vacation, if this is your taste head to Yellowstone today, you wont be disappointed."

We understand why this is a popular spot for artists an photographers. The view of the lower falls from Artist's Point is certainly beautiful. However, among canyons and waterfalls, we have seen others similar, so this was not one of our favorite areas of Yellowstone. Artists Point and Inspiration Point are worth a stop if you are in the area. Did not care for the hikes to the brinks of the two falls. Not a good spot for viewing and appreciating the falls. Having visited Grand Canyon NP 3 years ago, any place using those two words in its title is stretching it. The canyon is impressive--and the only one of its kind in Yellowstone--but we would not describe it as 'grand.'"

You can get to either side of the canyon; you can view it from top level overlooks; or you can take paths down into the canyon to view the waterfalls etc. more closely. We stuck to the overlooks and the epic views they provided. The trails down look to be fun and allow for close up, or a different angled view from down inside the canyon. Some trails don't go down to the falls, some are farther down the canyon and just provide a different perspective. They are not for the out of shape or injured, as they are very steep and long windy paths. However, they provide amazing views for those who wish to take them. That said, you do not need to in order to enjoy this magnificent area of the park.

We were on our way to attend a wedding. However, we ensured that we reached Artist's point on the lower rim as early in the day as possible. Wise decision. especially on the weekend.
The stunning views of the lower water falls, the ""painted"" valleys with bright colors from oxidized metals, the blue sky, the green vegetation, around the water is a perfect place for photographs. However, everyone who comes there has the same idea. The area where one can take pictures or view the scenery is limited and thus potential to create congestion. Thus, we started from here and went to the north rim later on.
It is difficult to explain the beauty in words. Thus, you have to see it!!

The Yellowstone River was turquoise blue and wove through the canyon with very high walls of many colors like yellow, coral, pink! We took the South Rim trail and it was easy with some hilly paths. There are numerous overlooks and any one of them is just amazingly beautiful. We hiked to Artists Point and there's a wonderful lookout area there where you can see the canyon in both directions and the Lower Falls. The Lower Falls are super cool with the green color that is in the water at the top! Never saw that before! We hiked down the North Rim to the Lower Falls overlook where you are right at the top of those falls and it's breathtaking! That was somewhat strenuous getting down and then back up but well worth it. Take your time and stop and rest!

Spend the day going to see the falls from each viewing point","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60999-d290469-r400335309-Grand_Canyon_of_the_Yellowstone-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html","Jul 2016 • Couples","One of the most beautiful things to see and do in Yellowstone. We spent one day hiking, climbing up and climbing down to see the falls from each viewing point. It is so gorgeous. The ""artist point"" is the easiest hike and very dramatic view. The ""Uncle Tom's Trail"" is a lot of overhead and a lot of stairs. The view is nice but the standing area at the base of the trail is small and as soon as you get down there, you feel pressure to leave because there isn't enough room for a lot of people to stand around there resting. The North Rim Trail was the most worth-it in my opinion as it is not a strenuous trail to the falls or back, it is a series of ramps instead of stairs and the view is unreal. Hiking around the falls is fun, great exercise and the views are not-to-be-missed. Bring your camera, good sneakers or trail shoes, a hat and some water."

We started out at the South Rim Drive then did the Brink of the Upper Falls and finished with the North Rim Drive. Best to get out there early as it gets packed quickly. If you want to get pictures (like panoramas) without others in your pics you will need to be there by 9am. Parking was the best here versus anywhere else in the park but again we were there early. The views were spectacular! Worth the walk down to Artist Point and at the Brink of Upper Falls. We did not do Uncle Tom's Trail as we could see lots from the smaller walks. We are glad we didn't as we saw a lot of people struggling back up the stairs (you get a good view point of the trail from the Brink). Lookout Point and Grand View are also good places to stop as they give great views of the canyon below. Inspiration Point is closed until 2018 for renovations."

The steps are metal and steep. At times, I was holding onto the railing with both hands. At the bottom is a platform with a bench. There are also some benches along the way.

The south rim trail hije is a beautiful mix of meadows, cliff views, geysers and the stairs. You can choose to view the waterfall from Artisans point or do the stairs we chose both and we were amazed at the beauty. We did not see any bears on this hike, however we did see fresh claw marks on the trees. Bring bear spray you can purchase or rent the spray. A must do hike."

The park staff kept the roads clear and accessible, and all the attractions and signs were well marked. the mas and signage were always up to date, and the speed recommendations were quite appropriate. I would recommend that the park should put marked speed bumps warning bumps before the worst curves, but only a negligent driver could have ignored the signs. Be advised: most cell reception falls apart within the park. We stopped at numerous roadside attractions and viewed many geysers. The signage and staff explained in detail science (geology and geography). As standalones, the sites viewing some waterfalls and hillsides are not fully accessible, and had not apparent features for readers needing assistance (poor mobility, blindness). We strongly recommend the Boiling River Spa, even with its limited accessibility. We were pleasantly surprised by the accessibility and proximity to certain wild animals (bison/female moose), although the bears, bighorn sheep, and male moose were conspicuously; absent. I recommend wearing hats in July, and to keep a camera ready as wildlife appear a lot closer to the human activity than expected."

The great thing about Yellowstone is that you don't have to work hard to see great scenery. It is simply everywhere.
This place offers a breath taking view deep into earth with a roaring river for a back drop. There are multiple places to view this and I would recommend the south rim parking area and a walk east off the asphalt and away from the crowds. There is a great trail that goes to Ribbon Lake that follows the rim for about .5 mile. I would recommend that. For sure
My biggest complaint was crowds. We spent a total of 4 days in Yellowstone and two places were crowded beyond my comfort were the South Rim parking lot and Old Faithful. Try to get away from the crowds and enjoy that absolute gift from God."

This place is breath taking, and you will never tire of visiting or looking at this majestic place. There are two waterfalls that empty in to the awe inspiring canyon - Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone. You can walk (trails) to both of these falls, and you must DO this. In fact, there are several other places along the canyon that are famous for viewing the canyon. In addition to the falls, make sure you take Uncle Tom's Trails (really a stair case that goes in to the canyon), and Artist Point and Inspiration Point. I encourage you to visit these points before 9:30 am or after 5 pm to avoid the tour buses that will dump large numbers of people at once making it difficult to take photos of the beautiful scenery. Carry water with you at all times. There are also plenty of restrooms around most of these points. In fact, there is a large, modern restroom facility before you take Uncle Tom's Trail. We stayed at the Canyon Lodge (we loved it) and visited the canyon every day for four days. We never tired of it."

The North Rim in particular is people crazy in the afternoon so start your day there. Decide which stop is the most interesting and make that your starting point. Do everything including any hiking that can take you a half mile from the parking lot. You will shed people like a mink coat.
The South Rim is less populated with fewer stops. It offers every bit as much amazing stuff as the North Rim just fewer places to check it out.
Plan a full day in the Canyon area. Don't miss the soda counter in the General Store in the Canyon developed area. Its a so fun 50s authentic experience (except for the prices and the ""earth friendly"" throw away serving ""dishes"")."

Are stones yellow there? Having been to Yellowstone several times before, but never visited the Grand Canyon area, I always just said that I had no idea.
Well, now that I've been there, I can say that the cliffs in this area is indeed yellow, and perhaps that's why the river and park are named that way?
There are roads and view points that line both side of the canyon. There are several water falls, but due to geography, you can't see more than one fall from a single view point. Some view points also require slight hikes, so plan accordingly.
We didn't go to the north side this time. But I must say that the lower fall is a lot prettier, and you must visit Artist Point if you don't mind walking a little bit. The views are awesome, and worth the effort.
It's not as deep or expansive as Grand Canyon N.P., but the canyon itself is nevertheless quite pretty. As I mentioned, the yellow-colored cliff is something unique.
Definitely worth a stop here."

We were amazed at the colors and grandeur. We also visited the upper falls. It was amazing to see the power of the water as it fell over the land."

Be prepared for crowds, but the views and hikes are lovely. If we could only be at every major site in Yellowstone in the morning or evening! :)"

We took the hike from the lower falls to the upper fallls and Artist's Point. The trail follows along the canyon. The beauty here is amazing."

It is nice to try all those trails. But if your time is limited, I recommend the South Rim Drive trails. It is a 2-mile round trip, from Uncle Tom's Trail to Artist Point. The best time to avoid the crowd is the morning before 10:00am or the late afternoon."

Even better if you can take the short hike down to see the waterfall. It's a little steep but if you can manage is worth the walk."

Alot of our pictures just look fake since the view is so beautiful. I suggest going in the evenings as there are ALOT less people, and you can enjoy the hikes and views in more peace."
