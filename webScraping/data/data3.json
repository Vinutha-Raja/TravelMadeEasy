     "comment": "#3 in my rankings of Utah's Mighty 5 national parks. Hey, twice in my life I've looked at a natural wonder and thought, \"This CAN'T be real. I must be on another planet.\" The first was the Grand Canyon. The second? Bryce Canyon National Park. But I personally give it \"bad\" marks because it's so hard to do the best activity in this park: hiking down (and, dear God!, back up) among the hoodoos. At 68, I tried a short descent and return and about died! From the rim, it's frustrating to see but not be able to \"touch.\""

     "comment": "We really enjoyed our visit to this national park. We spent a day and half in Bryce Canyon and we spent another day at Kolob Canyon - both were spectacular! There were many different cliffs and hoodoos that were simply majestic. The scenic overlooks and hiking trails were well marked making it easy to get through the park. There are plenty of trail options from easy to strenuous. We went at the end of October so the crowds were very manageable - still plenty of people but not anything that hindered our plans. The only negative to our visit was the very rude and unhelpful park ranger at the visitor center."

     "comment": "We had about a half day to spend in Bryce on our way through. I think we did a pretty good job planning it out. We got started about sunrise, but there were clouds in the sky. So rather than go directly to Sunset Point, we drove the long road out to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points, stopping at some of the overlooks along the way. The views were very nice, but my favorite was the Natural Bridge Overlook, which featured a beautiful natural bridge so close we could almost touch it. Once we arrived at Rainbow Point, we spent about a half hour just walking along the edge looking down into an amphitheater I've never seen before. It is not quite as spectacular as the main Bryce Amphitheater, but it was vast and it was beautiful, and I've wanted to come here for many years. It also had a lot more \"green\" in it. We proceeded to hike the Bristlecone Loop Trail, which included Yovimpa overlook. This was a fairly easy and enjoyable hike. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the bristlecones have seen better days. I definitely recommend this hike. It helped me to feel like I'd seen the \"entire\" park, rather than just the front-end like most visitors.\nWe then drove back to the Sunset Point, stopping briefly at Inspiration Point for some good views of the main amphitheater. The colors were stunning by now as the sun had emerged from the clouds and we had a perfect side view of the valley. Upon arriving at Sunset Point, we hiked up to the rim and then completed a very nice loop trail that went down into the canyon. We started by following the Rim Trail from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point. We then hiked down along the Queens Garden Trail. The trail was a bit steep, but high quality and not too crowded. At this point I realized the reviews were correct in noting that the best views in Bryce are from beneath the rim. Magnificent! Truly marvelous! Once we reached the junction with the Navajo Loop Trail, we turned and hiked up to the rim. Wall Street is closed this time of year, but the Navajo Trail was still great. I must admit, it was a bit steep, but the views were so beautiful that the steepness was hardly noticeable. We saw the Two Towers and Thor's Hammer and we noted all the pine trees along the trail that somehow get enough sunlight to grow tall.\nOverall, Bryce is an amazing park. I would definitely recommend coming here in late October and/or early November like we did as the weather was cool, the crowds were virtually non-existent, and the little dabs of snow here and there spiced things up a bit."

     "comment": "Entering Bryce Canyon NP in the morning, I once again marveled at the extraordinary craftsmanship of nature. The crumbling rocks stand tenaciously, and the wrinkles washed out by wind and rain seem to tell the vicissitudes of ages. Against the background of the blue sky and white clouds, the ochre-colored rocks are just beautiful. So far so good. We decided to take the Two Bridges from Sunset Point first. Although the trail was short, the switchbacks on the steep hill trigger my unrecovered thigh soreness from Angels Landing climb. After a short break at noon, I went to the Queens Garden from Sunrise Point. Unexpectedly, the weather changed suddenly on the way, the temperature dropped very quickly, and the snow started to drift. I temporarily changed the plan and went through the loop from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point. Finding Victoria Queen hoodoo in the wind and snow, walking through the various stone forests, is also a different experience. There were only few cars left when we returned to the once crowded parking lot. Next morning we came to Sunrise Point to watch the sunrise, the warm morning light illuminates the stone forest making them looks translucent.\nThe local Indian tribe is Navajo. According to their legend, Coyote will petrify people with bad deed into sculptures here."

     "comment": "Even though the day started out as pouring rain and foggy, Bryce Canyon still stole the show with its spectacular scenery. Bryce is so different from all the other parks and is truly amazing.\nWe were touring Utah in early October and only had one day to see the park. We are not big hikers, so we were just planning to drive to the pullouts and see the easy viewpoints. We thought because of the weather it was going to be a total wash out. To our surprise, we were still able to see the incredible hoodoos from most of the viewpoints. Scenery past the hoodoos in the distance was pretty foggy, but it made for some interesting pictures! What saved our visit was the fact that you can see so much of the park right from the pullouts, without any major hikes.\nAll of the pullouts are on the left, so definitely drive to the end first, and visit the viewpoints going back. We were especially impressed with Inspiration Point. That was our choice for the best sunrise viewpoint. Oh well, maybe next time! Natural Bridge was another favorite, it was stunning, especially with the fall colors. And it is a very short walk to see the view. Also make a point to see Fairyland Point. It is actually outside the entrance, and is easily missed. It is not mentioned much, but it has a very impressive view of the hoodoos and photographs well.\nPay attention to the temperature forecasts, because Bryce is much colder than surrounding areas because of its elevation at 7000 to 9000 feet. In the early morning in October it was in the low 40’s. Stay hydrated too, to avoid altitude sickness, especially if hiking.\nWe were so impressed with Bryce Canyon, even in the rain, so we will try it again the next time we are in Utah, and look forward to tackling some of the easier hikes."

     "comment": "We try to visit at least one new National Park every year, and this year was Bryce Canyon! The views are as amazing as every picture you have ever seen. How was the spectacular canyon and it's hoodoos formed? - The natural forces of weathering and erosion, from ice and rain created Bryce Canyon. What once was a plateau, the rocks ha e broken down, and eventually became the incredible individual hoodoos.\nWe love to travel in the Fall to avoid the massive crowds and the extreme temperatures of summer. In late October the weather (mid 50°) was perfect for sightseeing and hiking. We were able to get 8 to 12 miles of hiking on each day of our two day visit, on the wonderfully maintained park trails. The views from Sunset, Sunrise, Inspiration, and Bryce Point were all amazing, but the real adventure is experiencing it from inside the canyon! We can't wait to return!\nOnly a few small negatives! Too few bathroom facilities, next to no food options, and a lot of the park signage needs refreshing."

We spent one full day and one evening here. The photo ops never end. I suggest that if you want to see the whole park, you drive always to the end and work your way back. Most of the viewpoints are on your right side then. There is a shuttle you can ride, but from what I can tell, it only runs to part of the park and not very early or late."

Stop at the visitor center to get information from the rangers about the park and how you can plan your day, based on weather, expected crowds, and fitness ability. Take your time to relax and enjoy the park. Take a picnic lunch, and use one of the picnic tables available. Hike a couple trails. We hiked Queen's Garden and Wall Street. Sunset to Sunrise. We stopped at all the lookout points. We drove the length of the park. Breathe the fresh air. Couldn't ask for a better day. Best part about this trip was the drive on Hwy 12 from Capitol Reef Park. Just Amazing. Of the five Utah national parks, this had the easiest and shortest hiking options. My boys (16 and 12) enjoyed the other parks better.

While this really isn't enough it was definitely worth the stop over and if we're passing through the area again we'll be sure to spend more time here. We started by doing the scenic drive. We drove out to Rainbow Point ( the second to last point), which had stunning views. It was hard to find parking here but well worth the effort. We then drove back towards the entrance, hitting many of the scenic view points along the way back. There was a food truck at one of them so we were able to do a quick picnic lunch before starting a hike. Many of the popular hiking trails start at Sunset and Sunrise Point so parking in those areas was also difficult. We ended up parking at the Bryce lodge's visitor parking, which is located between the two points. It was a quick walk to the Sunset/Sunrise path from there. That path alone has stunning views, but from there we connected to the Navajo Loop trail. We started by hiking down to Wall Street and then doing Two Bridges on the way back up. If you have limited time to hike Wall Street is definitely the area you want to see.\nOn a side note, we lucked and ended up going to Bryce on a free day. We didn't know they had free days. If you don't have then annual national parks pass it's worth checking online to see if there are any upcoming free days before planning your visit as the normal cost is $35/car."

Having been to a number of Ntl Parks over the past month it is the first to show a blatant snd consistent disregard for the enforcement of visitors to wear masks and social distancing in all buildings. In addition, the Ntl Park team at Bryce had the most minimal signage across the various park buildings advising people to mask up. Very very disappointed in the Bryce Ntl Park Staff and their employees."

You really appreciate the beauty after hiking down into the canyon and looking back up. I must say you will need to take your time hiking to enjoy all that is there to see. The trails are tame enough for most to travel so just about anyone can take part in this park."

     "comment": "If you are a hiking enthusiast, Bryce is a wonderland. But even if you come here just to enjoy the views, you should budget about 4 hours to drive through the park and stop at the many viewpoints.\nVirtually everything in Bryce that cries out for a photograph is situated to the east of the park road, so it's easy to find great panoramic shots, great shots where the rocks are bathed in light or muted by shadows, but you will have only a few chances to film light and shadow in tandem. In the early morning or late afternoon, look for viewpoints that lay out the rocks in a half circle, one face in shadow and the other in light. Bryce is one of our most photogenic parks ... and don't forget the stretch of UT 12 east of the traffic circle. There are some great vistas between the circle and Tropic, and beyond Tropic UT 12 is one of America's most scenic byways. If you are heading for Moab, this is the route to take!"

Every stop was unique and had vistas that took your breath away. Rainbow point is the highest drivable vista in the park and gives you a breathtaking view of the canyon. The welcome center is full of information and plenty of park Rangers to help. The film was informative and worth sticking around for. The Bryce Canyon Inn was also worth the side trip to visit, having period funiture and pictures of past experiences in the park."

There is a shuttle that will pick you up from your campsite or hotel room and bring you to any of the be 3 restaurants onsite, the huge general store, the cute little Old Town Bryce stores, or Soar Utah. This is a virtual reality ride that takes you soaring over the parks of Utah with a 360 degree view! It was so beautiful, I cried.\nFinally, we ate at Ebenezer's Barn and Grill which served great food and had a wonderful country music show. Soo worth it! Finally there is a rodeo on most days."

Not only that, there were little to no crowds, and we saw plenty of deer and other critters running around.\nMy advice, go in the morning (or maybe the evening).

We parked in the lot across from the visitors center and then told one of the rangers that we only had a few hours to visit. He suggested the Rim Trail as a way to see a lot of what the park has to offer in one short visit.\nWe took the free shuttle that is offered and got off near the start of the trial. Right from the start, the views were mind-boggling. It's a long trail but worth every step to catch the sites we were able to see.\nAs we made our way along the trail we saw hoodoos, gorgeous cliffs, the amphitheater and so many beautiful and colorful formations. There was even a chipmunk who was smart enough to pose for photos at one of the stopping points.\nWhen we got to the lodge we were very hungry and glad to be able to buy sandwiches and drinks before catching the shuttle back to the visitor center to leave."

The book said that if you only visit one national park, it should be Bryce. I would have to concur with that statement. The park is BEAUTIFUL! There are so many varied hoodoos, and they are just stunning. They are so unique and beautiful. My husband agrees that this is his favorite national park, and we have visited 41 so far. We highly recommend the Canyon Trail Ride (half day is the most worthwhile) and hiking the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop trail. We've done both on the same day each visit. (Separate reviews on each of these are available for more information.) You can't go wrong with a visit to this park."

     "comment": "This was my 4th visit to Bryce Canyon and it never disappoints. We were lucky to find a room at the BC Lodge, which is a 5 min walk to the rim. The park offers shuttle service to the major lookout points but the rim area between sunset point and sunrise point is flat, paved and easy for anyone (even with mobility challenges) to enjoy the scenery. We hiked the Navajo Trail through Wall Street (amazing slot-like canyon) and then caught Peek A Boo trail (counter clockwise). Our original plan was to do the \"figure 8\" of these two trails totaling around 6 miles but it was hot and we were running low on water. We detoured up the trail to Bryce Point and caught a shuttle back to Sunset (where we started). There are compost toilets in the summer on Peek A Boo near Bryce point but there's no water. The park did not feel crowded in mid-July. There was steady flow of visitors but once you're a quarter mile from the rim on a trail you're not seeing many people. This is by far one of our favorite parks. It's not stressful due to crowds, it offers basic services (food, lodging, bathrooms with running water) and more honestly enjoyable than the madness we experienced at Zion & Arches."

Unfortunately due to rain, all of the trails inside the canyon was closed. I appreciate the availability of the shuttle bus, but we chose to drive to each of the scenic points. Parking was limited, but we never had an issue. The ridge trail was open as well as the visitor center. The park has amazing views from every location. It is worth the trip even if you only have 2-3 hours and only stop along the ridge trail. This is a must see National Park if you are in the area.

All of the trails we hiked had simply spectacular views, felt safe, and most felt friendly for children and seniors. Photos simply do not do Bryce justice; the scenery is definitely distinct from Zion (although it's only a two-hour drive away), with the largest concentration of hoodoos in the whole world. Just make sure to dress warmly because it's much colder in Bryce. All in all, definitely stop by for a magnificent day in Bryce!"

We did the rim trail for most of the distance; we used the bus system between one short segment; we found the rim trail to be fairly walkable; there are grade changes, but nothing we couldn't handle. We used the shuttle system and found it to be well managed and easy to use; we shuttled to the far end and walked back (most of the way).\nYounger folks who hike would probably enjoy the more challenging trails into the canyon. There is certainly a lot to explore and the scenery is unique and beautuiful. No matter your skill level--take water with you."

We were able to hike and see some of the most unreal sights! Highly recommend this! We hiked the sunrise to sunset trail. It was so serene and beautiful. I could've spent hours there. The pictures do not do this place justice! We ended up hiking about 3.5 miles and it was about 2.5 hours. The canyon was stunning!"

     "comment": "This NP took my breath away because it is just unreal how the hoodoos jet up from the ground with incredible colors that look different depending on how the sun hits it. We did the Queen gardens trail going down into the hoodoos and came back up through the Navajo trail (Wallsteet). This is a bit challenging if not in a good shape, but it is well worth the hike. The total hike was about 4.5miles. Take your water, hat, and sunscreen with you. Plenty of rock squirrels and chipmunks. The amphitheater is just stunning. We visited late in the morning and parking was not an issue. The annual pass is a great way to see multiple NPs and it can be purchased from any of the NPs entry. We used ours to access 6 NPs in 2 weeks. It’s good for a year and costs $80. Entry to Bryce Canyon alone is $35 per car. We stayed in Kanab and drove 1.5hrs for a day trip to Bryce. Kanab is an easy launch pad for seeing Zion and Bryce and the city also has plenty to offer on its own."

We walked along the rim of the amphitheater and were in awe at all of the giant Hoodoos. We started down one of the switchback trails but came to our senses when we looked back up the hill at the steep return, so bailed out and went back. Many young people were hiking all the way down and back up but it is extremely challenging as I watched them huffing and puffing and guzzling water after the trek. An amazing view."

On the way back we hit most of the pull off scenic sites and took amazing pictures - we particularly liked natural bridge. We also spent a considerable amount of time at Bryce amphitheater- the highlight of the park. We walked down Wallstreet trail and also did the easy Sunrise to Sunset trail - which clocked in at just about a mile of paved walking. In total, we spent almost 4 hours in the park which was just enough to have a good visit - we could have done much more, especially hiking, but this fit our plans and everyone had a great experience."

This was one of the most beautiful, unique landscapes I have ever seen. We loved this hike! Some of it was in sun, some in snow...it was so varied that we didn't get tired of it at all. At the end, we found a ranger who suggested we to go Bryce Point to see the best sunset. We headed that way, had time to drive to Inspiration Point first, and saw the sunset which was really gorgeous. (Note-I imagined beach sunsets and sunrises, so had this as a major priority. In reality, it's more the way the light changes on what you are looking at which makes it a \"good time to go\". You won't see beautiful colors in the sky so much.)"

     "comment": "So glad we finally made Bryce Canyon NP our destination. Unbelievable experience! We stayed near the park at a local motel in Panguitch. That allowed us to get an early start around 7:00 am which was a great decision. We were able to enter the park before collection booths were staffed (so we experienced the park without paying a fee.) We were traveling with our dog, so we needed to drive our car versus taking a shuttle or going on a tour. By chance, we ignored the first few vistas and headed further down the 18 mile scenic drive. (Sort of like skipping the first few rides and heading to the back rides when the amusement park opens up.) That meant that we got to all those additional scenic views with pull off areas without combatting any traffic, difficulties parking or large groups of other people. The final area at the end of that drive is a more area equipped with restrooms and tables. By the time were turned around and headed back to the entrance of the park around 9:00, the park had filled up. We tried to check out the first few vistas we skipped. That was difficult and we battled crowds at each attempt making driving, parking and viewing much more difficult. We did head out after spending about 2 hours in the park which was good enough for a first visit. And yes, the views were incredible."

Incredible scenery with a large elevation change but so worth it. It kicked our butt on a hot June day. Wall Street was an incredible climb up-we finished by hiking sunset point back to our start at sunrise point. (Approximately 8 miles) We had plenty of water and packed a lunch. It took us 4.5 hrs. We also drove to Bryce point and Paria view. Ended our day at rainbow point, Yovimpa point, and hiked the bristlecone trail. We were completely exhausted but enjoyed every bit of it. Colors and the hoodoos and the scenery we’re amazing!￼ Don’t miss this park."

Also it is relatively small and could be experienced in a single day if pressed for time. Please note that the temperatures vary a lot and while we were there in late May the temperature in the morning was in the low 30s and did not get above 55 the entire day. One negative in this park was the poor signage and markings in the trailheads and on the trails in particular. We could not find the start of the trails and could get lost on the trails themselves. We were not the only ones — we ran into folks who were asking us for directions while we ourselves did not know where we were. But overall , highly, highly recommended for a visit."

     "comment": "A truly magical national park, Bryce Canyon National Park is one of my all-time faves. The towering hoodoo rock formations awash in bright splashes of brilliant, sunny colors will take your breath away.\nYou can certainly visit this park from the comfort of your own car. However, I would highly recommend devoting at least a full day here to hike the fantastic trails. Wall Street and Queens Garden were my two favorites. There's a wonderful loop that takes you from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point along those two trails and the Rim Trail along the canyon top.\nInspiration point is also another can't miss. Don't forget to hike the 5 to 10 minutes up from the parking lot to your right for it even more glorious vistas. The entire Canyon looks like a massive amphitheater filled with a packed audience of playful hoodoos.\nThe Natural Bridge is nice and worth a quick stop for a photo op. However, if you're tight on time, I don't think you need to drive past Inspiration Point."

It immediately hits you as something amazing. This park also has a rim trail that is great for someone who isn't in great shape. The rim trail is paved and flat.

I know not using a car in the parks is more environmentally good but sometimes the shuttle systems just don't work very well. Bryce has an 18 mile road up to a vista point. There are various trails from here. We did the Bristlecone Pine trail. One mile RT thru spruce/fir forests to cliffs with bristlecone pines and fantastic views. There were signs of a past fire up here. Being old folks, we don't do much hiking down into canyons anymore and this was a really nice trail for us. All along this 18 mile road there are areas to pull off for views or hikes. The hoodoos are gorgeous - red stone everywhere. Early the next morning we headed to the Mossy Cave trail - not to be missed either. You have to exit the park to get to this section. It is the only place in the park where the trail is completely on the canyon floor. Instead of looking down on the hoodoos you have to look up at them. There is a waterfall, stream and yes, there actually is a little mossy cave.\nDon't miss Bryce Canyon."

Sunrise brings the sun straight onto the vertical structures with shadows facing you. As the sun rises, the light goes deeper into the crevices . In the evening, the sun lights up the surfaces facing you. So, you could see the park 3 times with a different effect each time. Mornings will be busy with limited parking available. Take the shuttles as an option starting around 8 AM."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon National Park is one of the most incredible landscapes I have EVER visited in my entire life. Bryce is filled with Hoodoos - rocks that are weathered and eroded to create incredible formations. Fantastic to behold.\nYou can drive throughout the whole park and see some incredible and stunning views without hiking!\nIf you want to Hike:\nDo the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden Trail. This takes you down into the canyon so you can walk among the shadow of the hoodoos. There is one with a switchback area of this trail called ‘Wall Street.” I recommend walking this section. Most people don’t know this and do the opposite. It is a 2.5 mile heavily trafficked loop trail.\nDon't miss the Mossy Cave Waterfall hike. You must leave the park a tiny bit, but you get to see a waterfall and a sleeping bear cave. It is a magical beautiful hike. It is an easy 1-mile trail and you get to see a waterfall!\nIf you can do Bryce’s Rime Trail Hike. It is 0.5 miles to 5.5 miles one way and it is located above Bryce Canyon. It connects all the scenic overlooks from Fairyland to Bryce Point. If you do NOT want to hike, many of these viewpoints are accessible by car too! If you are looking for an accessible trail, there is a 0.5-mile section of trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point that is wheelchair accessible. I love the Rime Trail hike because you can choose to do as much or as little hiking as you want!"

     "comment": "We spent a week in the Zion (National Park) area before driving to Bryce Canyon. This left us with expectations of Bryce that were not realistic. Don't get me wrong, it was gorgeous just not what we anticipated. In Zion you are usually looking up and surrounded by canyons, cliffs and rock formations. With Bryce we were always looking down on the interesting topography and unless there was time to hike down and back, you couldn't get close and personal to the fantastic structures. We did much research and read that the road in and back is 15-18 miles long. Every scenic overlook or hiking trail turns off to the west, which would be a left turn across traffic if you stopped at each one along the way in. Taking the road to the end and working our way back allowed us to turn with traffic. This was late April, the roads were crowded and parking was sparse and we cannot imagine how this will play out as summer draws near. That being said, Bryce Canyon was a fantastically magical sort of place and we are so glad to have experienced this wonder of nature!"

     "comment": "My family visited in March on our tour of all five national parks in Utah. Bryce did not disappoint. We arrived around noon and were able to do a variety of hikes and viewing around the park over 7 hours. We could probably have done the park in two days but we were fine with one.\nI highly recommend going to the back of the parks 18 mile road and working your way towards the front. By the end of the day, we barely had any traffic but at noon when we arrived, the front parking lots were full.\nOur favorite hike was the Navajo/Queens loop. You really get to see the amazing hoodoos up close. The hike has some elevation and steep switchbacks, but it’s so worth it. There are also a lot of lookout points while driving, take advantage of them all."

Upon arrival we drove to Natural Bridge lookout and then up to Rainbow Point. The cold and wind kept both visits short. We then hiked Navajo and Queen’s Garden trail. It took about 3 hours to do the entire trail. Amazing hike and very different from Zion and Grand Canyon. Most restaurants around Bryce are closed. We ate at Pizza Place in Tropic and Ruby’s Inn for a breakfast buffet. Many websites and Yelp are not accurate in their hours of operation."

Right now the shuttles were not running so you were able to drive your own car, we did not have any issues finding parking but I’m sure that will be changing shortly. A lot of people miss out on the Mossy Cave hike. It’s a easy 1 mile round trip and you will see some amazing scenery. It is considered part of Bryce Canyon but it is about 5 minutes away from the main park."

But nothing can tip the moment you step onto the first viewing spot. It is breathtaking...almost a spiritual experience.\nThe visitor center is right after entering the park. Worth a stop to get the Rangers’ insight on what to see and do. “Icy trails” update altered my visit a bit. I drove to the opposite end of the park, Rainbow Point, and then stopped at viewing points on the way back. I even set up a tailgate picnic for lunch - best PB&J I’ve ever had.\nMake it a point to hike to the top of Inspiration Point. It is the best view and photo op, in my opinion.\n(Flat KeeKee is a character from the children’s book “KeeKee’s Big Adventures” and is joining me for this adventure)"

After doing the scenic drive and stopping at sites and looking out and down, we spent the next day hiking into Bryce Canyon and experiencing it from a different viewpoint. What incredible scenery. It is spectacular and worth visiting.\nBased on a fellow traveller's tip, we hiked Navajo trail and then went to Queen's Garden. So down and then up and since Queen's Garden is less \"vertically upward\" while still challenging, it did give us more of a chance to really focus on the hoodoos and mountains as we wound our way upward. Bring walking sticks - they help.\nThis park is a must see. We lucked out as the November day was gorgeous, sunny and warm."

We had visited the Grand Canyon the day before, which was spectacular, but I really think I loved Bryce even more.\nWe drove to the very end of the loop without stopping and then stopped at all the stops on the way back. When we went it was not crowded at all and parking was not a problem (sometimes it is but apparently, not during a pandemic). People were wearing masks, for the most part but I wasn't worried because everything was outdoors.\nBryce is one of the most unique places. I enjoyed the Grand Canyon but it is very GRAND. Bryce felt smaller and more intimate. Even though we didn't go down in to the canyon, I felt like I was more a part of it then at the Grand Canyon. Such BEAUTIFUL scenery - everywhere you look is a picture.\nI can't recommend this National Park highly enough - so beautiful and so thankful it has been preserved so beautifully."

We wanted to stay in their tree house but they only have two and they were full. We got a cabin that was awesome. They also have a fantastic restaurant on site, beautiful view and fantastic food...make reservations.\nWe got up early to view the sunrise at Bryce Canyon at Sunset Point and it was breathtaking. Take a tripod and watch the magic happen. Wear layers, walking stick, good walking shoes, hat, sunscreen, water and camera. The hike amongst the hoodoos is fantastic, take your time, stop and rest, enjoy your surroundings and keep hydrated. After our hike we went out through the park entrance and ate breakfast, then we stopped at the park information center and signed up for a night sky ranger talk for later that night.\nWe went back into the park and stopped at different look outs. We ate dinner at our lodge and went back for night sky viewing and talk about stars and planets. We did faintly see the Milky Way. We also went back to the hoodoos at night and took photos. It was my first try at night sky photography with an iPhone. They were a bit blurry but you can get some great photos at night! Try it.\nVisually stimulating park. Definitely recommend seeing this once in your lifetime."

We did Inspiration point, Bryce point, Sunset point, and Sunrise. Inspiration point parking was icy and a few people got stuck trying to get in. We had a 4 wheel drive care so we didn’t have any problems. Just to see the views is worth the $35 fee. You receipt is good for 7 days so if you are planning on spending a few days hiking it’s extremely worth the cost. The visitors center is really nice and the park staff is super helpful. They are very knowledgeable and can help with any of your trail questions. I definitely recommend hiking boots and chains in the snow. We had on sneakers and they didn’t have enough traction. Overall amazing! Can’t wait to go back in the spring so we can hike."

Although not one of the most popular parks, Bryce is full of unique rock structures and formations. There is no other place like this anywhere on Earth. The hoodoo rocks are interesting and formed through a erosion process that is not present anywhere else. In late October crowds were very reasonable with ample parking everywhere we visited.\nThere are several hikes that you can do in Bryce Canyon National Park. Navajo Loop and queens Garden trails are the most popular, and they're great to do. If you don't like to hike, you can drive around and stop at various you points to see the rock formations. In all honesty, the views are actually best from on top before you hike down into the canyon.\nEither way, Bryce Canyon National Park is one of the national parks that you simply must visit."

     "comment": "Pretty much everything about our visit to Bryce was amazing, although we were there late in the season and a lot of the amenities were already closed or reduced. The scenery is obviously amazing - beautiful, and there is so much variety throughout the park and all its hikes. Definitely do the Quee's Garden/Navajo loop hike - it's a bit challenging but certainly worth it. I'd recommend going through Wall Street on that hike in the afternoon, as it lights up beautifully with the afternoon sun. (Also I'd go UP the Navajo Loop side - I think some of the steep bits would feel slippery coming down but going up they are just steep and require The occasional break.) The scenic drive was all right, but if you have limited time I'd skip most of it and spend most of your time between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point, as there is so much beauty and so many hikes there. The paved trail from the campground to Sunset Point is a decent length for walking dogs if you bring yours, and you can see some great views from it.\nThe campgrounds are clean and spaced out, although it's difficult to visit since they are all reservation-less during late fall and it can be hit or miss whether you will find a site even getting there early. The rangers at the sites gave very helpful talks and tips, although the ones at the campground seemed a little overzealous. I understand that they have a tough job, but the day we were there they drove around every 20-30 minutes all morning and afternoon, staring down people sitting outside and not waving back or ever saying hello. While it wasn't bad, it had the effect of making me feel like a kid in school again, wondering if I was breaking a rule I didn't know about."

I would highly recommend parking near SUNSET point (not sunrise) for the sunrise and you can hike down a little to the Thor’s Hammer to get a nice opportunity. We saw sunrise from that area but moved around a little. Then, we hiked down the Navajo trail going down Wall Street and the switchbacks and then to the queens trail to sunrise point. Glad we did it that way. Many people went the opposite direction. But, I heard that this was a good direction to take."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon was very cool. It was surreal landscape you would never see anywhere else. We only went to Sunrise and Sunset points (we parked at the lodge and walked to them) and did the Queen’s Garden hike. The hike does have some very steep sections at the beginning, but other than that it wasn’t too difficult. We had a 3 year old (we had a leash attached to his arm just in case because there were major drop-offs) and an 8 year old and they handled it just fine. In the time of COVID I will say there were definitely sections of this hike that were narrow and we were there in the afternoon so there were lots of people, so we were glad we had our masks. We also did the quick Mossy Cave hike, which leads to a waterfall. The water was very cold, but the kids loved it. Again, lots of people so social distancing was not easy. If you’re in the area we’d recommend devoting at least a half day to see Bryce Canyon, it was definitely worth the time."

This was my husbands first hikey vacation so we started out easy.\nWe followed the trail to the left for the Navajo Loop. Folks of all ages were managing just fine from papoose carrying dads to little kids to near seniors like ourselves.\nComing through the Wall Street was breath taking and just awww bit challenging. The key is to rest and drink plenty of water.\nNext we drove to the end of the park and stopped at every vista along the way. Each view was better and majestic. We took a short windy hike at the end and headed back to base for a swim. Fantastic day!"

Simply fantastic!\nTake the 18 mile park road and stop at several of the sights along the way. They all look different and they are special in there own way. The great arch is a personal favorite.\nThen walk some or one of the trails. The Navajo loop is the best, but its not for the faint at heart and is an extremely difficult climb back to the top.\nBryce is now one of my favorites and we will be back!"

But you would lose the incredible overview. The views go on forever through the canyon. Trees that would dwarf you house are somehow reduced to shrub size by these rock formations.\nOutside of the canyon, the grounds are wooded and well kept. This park is made for cars but somehow is not over-run. You can walk 50 feet or less from your car and see all of the items I posted on this review. If you wish, the well made paths will lead into the canyon too."

Good hike take some water. We drove to Inspiration point. It Lived up to its name. It's the must see view point while visiting. We ended our day at Bryce Point.

First do the scenic drive to get a feel for everything the park has by pulling off and taking in the views at the various spots like Sunrise and Sunset points and the amphitheater. This park like the others (except Zion) is very user friendly for driving and the map provided gives you plenty of hiking options graded at easy, moderate, and strenuous along with distance.\nIf you have time, hike below the rim among the hoodos on trails like Queens Garden/Navajo loop and the Peekaboo trail, it feels like a different planet. Go early for everything as the park and the trails are wildly popular. More than any of the other parks, its hard to take photos that capture Bryce. You can get portions of it, but you just can't stop marveling at the landscape and how it changes as you hike."

Walking into the amphitheater is breathtaking and the trails that take you amongst the hoodoos are beyond beautiful. I felt there were trails for all ages, I hiked with my 65 year old mother and found many places I could take her that didn't wear her out. If you're not a hiker you can drive throughout the park and stop at all of the beautiful viewpoints. This park has something for everyone. We went two days in a row at various times to see how the sunlight changed the colors and in the evening we saw many Mule Deer which was also fun. There was even a food cart at one of the stops and their menu included vegetarian items (bonus for me.) The gift shop has a nice variety of items for sale. This is a wonderful place!!"

I was happy to see more stars than I have ever seen, although for the full show I suspect one needs to be awake at midnight or 1am.\nHowever as we were leaving, we saw a herd of deer grazing in one pasture and on the opposite side of the road the buck keeping watch. That was a magnificent moment, as I have seen deer before but never a herd or group! Wonderful!\nNonetheless, this quick trip was well worth every minute and a nice respite from being locked down in our home state.\nWe knew coming in the views and sights would be beautiful. What we did not know was just how amazing and well, simply wonderful they would be."

The hike was from one side of the rim, hike down and across, then back up to the other point. Not the hardest hike, but the way back up will make you pretty winded. Its only like a 3 mile hike so its not too bad. I'd say its worth it to go for just the views alone."

     "comment": "I had heard about it. I had seen pictures. But until you see it in person—you have no idea. To beat the crowds, we arrived at 0830 on a Sunday. We had the place to ourselves. What you read advises you to go to the far point and stop at points on the way back, as they are all on the right side of the road—which is what we did. Not sure I agree with that. By the time we arrived at sunrise/sunset/inspiration points, the most popular points,about 1100, it was very crowded. Had I it to do over, I would stop at these places first, before the crowds. Another note, if you’re into photography, morning isn’t the best time, as at most points you’re facing east and many views are in shadow. Great pictures are going to be in the afternoon."

Mossy cave you have to drive to, small waterfall nice streams good for kids."

The Cabin was steps from Sunrise Point, and in my opinion one of the most beautiful parts of the park. There are many trails to take and many pull outs. We used Just Ahead, a national parks app, and it directed us where to go and what we would see, if there were trails it would say how long, how far and if it was strenuous. We had only one day here and I could have stayed a few more easily had I known what I know now. Though I didnt rise at Sunrise I did get magical pictures just an hour or so later. With COVID the crowds were thin and we were able to really enjoy the park."

     "comment": "The hoodoos are really stunning. This is a great place to take photos and to hike. We combined the Queen’s Court Trail descent with the Navajo Trail ascent for a 3 mile hike. The descent was a little scary for me because of the sharp, steep drop offs at many points on the trail, sometimes on both sides. However, it was not difficult to stay safe, you just need to be aware. Its not a place where you can walk along while staring at your phone screen. Most of the trails lead down to the canyon floor where you wind through the rock formations before you have to ascend back to the top. There is no way to avoid an ascent. The trail we took stayed mostly along the canyon floor until the very end. The ascent consisted of a series of at least a dozen or more short switchbacks which were very steep. We ended our hike just before noon. It was a beautiful day, not all that hot, we are both in good shape and we found the ascent extremely strenuous since all of the elevation gain was packed in at the very end. We still enjoyed the hike and the park is amazing. I have hiked through other hoodoo formations before, but the sheer enormity and concentration of formations here is something that must be experienced. A photo cannot do it justice."

     "comment": "Bryce is a very cool place and situated in southern Utah, where you can find so many more cool things! I went for a day and visited all viewpoints. The bad thing was that all the smoke from the California wild fires filled the canyon with haze so it was all a bit nasty. My favorite viewpoint was Sunset Point and Inspiration Point, super cool places! I also recommend hiking down to Thor's Hammer and Wall Street when you're at Sunset Point. Sunrise and Sunset Point where both busy in the morning (Labor Day) and I couldn't find parking so I went to the very end and worked my way backwards. I would recommend though that before you go, make this more a hiking experience than a I go to viewpoint and look into the canyon experience. I'm not a hiker and just wanted to see stuff and I got the impression that the majority of people came for the hikes and actually hiked. Only doing Wall Street and Thor's Hammer, I really have to say, check out all the hikes and go on several because I personally felt that Bryce is, say compared to Grand Canyon, more of a hiking park than view point park!"

It's a very easy park to visit and you can make it whatever you want. If you want to just get out of your car and see the sites from the viewpoints, that's great and you'll see amazing scenery. If you want to hike and explore, there are many trails that take you down into wonderlands or across the rim. We especially like Yovimpa Point, the area in the southern part of the park. The Bristlecone Pine trail is fairly easy and not very long but gives you time in the forest.\nWe've enjoyed camping at Bryce before but this time we stayed at Ruby's Inn - a wonderful choice right outside the park.\nWatch for deer and squirrels and several kinds of birds. Look off into the distance to see mountains far away. Study the colors of the rock, various shades of orange and some with white tops. Go out and look at the night sky! You'll see thousands more stars than if you try in a city.\nThe view areas had social distancing reminders that were fun - see the pictures!"

The hike takes so long because you have to stop and look and take a picture around every band. Then the hike down into the Hoodoos is mystical and magical. Great for any age. I saw Kids from 8 to 80. The elevation is over 7000 feet so it is cooler even in the summertime. We did have to share one of the trails with some horse groups but mostly they are limited to their own trails."

Heading down into the canyon is a must if you can. We did the Navajo/Queen's Garden Combination Loop Trail. We started it by Sunrise Point and headed down into the canyon. The trail has uneven surfaces but once you get to the bottom it is pretty easy. They categorize this trail as moderate. Had we started at Sunset Point I would say it is moderate because we would be going down through the endless switchbacks. We chose to go up the switchback which was strenuous. We bring hiking poles to help us when we hike. They can help stabilize you as you hike. I loved Bryce and would go back to see the trails and overlooks we didn't get to see or hike."

Plus, if you are camping or just want to stay after dark, Bryce definitely has the best views of the stars anywhere around. If you travel out to the end of the park's road, you will be surrounded on three sides by vast canyons, very dark, where the stars come down to the horizon, which is below you. Magnificent!"

We purchased a park pass which gave us access to the free shuttle to take us through Bryce National Park. We stopped first at the Visitor Center and immediately went to the Information Tent outside. I signed us up for the Night Ranger Talk held at the North Amphitheater at 9pm. They only allow 40 people during COVID so you must sign up the same day and early. Then we hopped back on the shuttle and went to Bryce Point. This was one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. You can see the entire amphitheater from this view point. We took the advice from the shuttle driver and hiked the Rim Trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point about a 1.5 mile hike. If you are afraid of heights do not go. I was at first but then was so glad I went. It was a moderate hike and I would not take young children. Some parts are very narrow and the edge is very close. We hiked to Inspiration Point and hopped back on the shuttle back to the Shuttle Stop where we started. My son then rented a mountain bike for $25 for half a day and rode an 8 mile trail to Red Rock Canyon. I picked him up at the Tunnel. Then we rested back in our room. We went for dinner at The Pizza Place in Tropic and on our way back we stopped at Mossy Cave hike. It is very easy about half a mile and there is a small waterfall that you can walk behind. This was a great stop and highlight of our trip. Then we went back to room and rested and left for our night program at 8:30. The outdoor amphitheater has benches and a movie screen. The ranger spoke about animals seen at the canyon. One is the best parts was you could see a million stars in the sky just from sitting in the amphitheater. The ranger talk lasted 40 minutes and we were done for the day at 10 pm. Awesome day!"

RVs of that length are either required to park at the visitor center overflow; which would then require about a 3 mile round trip walk to the sights. Or someone is required to circle the area in the RV while the rest of the party goes to see the hoodoos.\nOn top of that dogs are only allowed on hardened surface pathways which is tough on their feet.\nSo if you’re planning a trip to Bryce Canyon NP. Leave your dogs at home and park outside the park and use the shuttle."

     "comment": "We chose to use the shuttle system and got off at the Bryce Point stop. We were told the mile and a half hike to Inspiration Point along the rim was relatively easy and had great views, so we decided to do that. We had a backpack full of Ice and Gatorade, sunscreen, and baseball caps, so we felt prepared for the 90+ degree journey. We took our time and meandered along, stopping whenever we wanted pictures or to enjoy a bit of the shade. Our home is at sea level, so we are not used to the elevation at all, and that was obvious anytime there was a bit of an elevation gain along our trail.\nOne of the best things was that even though we were there on a Sunday and it was crowded at the visitor center when we arrived, we only saw two other couples on our entire trek along that part of the rim. We felt like we were completely alone, which was very peaceful.\nThere was no problem getting on the shuttle when it was time to move on. We chose to stop at Sunset Point and see the views from there, and while beautiful, not comparable to what we had already seen. The shuttle wasn’t running to Rainbow Point, and we felt like we had seen enough, so decided to call it a day. I’m sure we missed out on some amazing views, but we were happy with how we spent our time at Bryce Canyon."

I had seen so many photos I was worried that nothing could really be so dramatic, I was wrong, photos don't do it justice! The expansive landscape of salmon colored Hodoo towers and Fin ridges is other worldly and the park is much larger in person.\nThe views from the overlooks are breathtaking, but the best experience is to take one or all of the trails down into the valley and back up through the sculptural stone towers. The trails are well designed, wide enough in many areas for 4 people across, they narrow down to go through towering ravines or stone openings. I also found the grades to be gradual and comfortable. But be prepared to climb up hill, the trip elevations changes range from 200 to 1500 feet. I was told the Navajo Trail/Queens Garden loop that I took had a 480 foot elevation change.\nFor me one day was not enough, I'd recommend at least two to give you time to explore north and south park trails. I guarantee you'll enjoy it!"

We choose to hike the Fairyland trail which is about 8 miles. It doesn’t have as many hoodoos but there are a lot less people on that side of the canyon. You do need to take plenty of water. We ended up being a water bottle short. The fairyland trail is easier going counterclockwise but you do have to climb up to the top twice on the way out."

Super magical!\nWe went up inspiration point for the perfect views and then did the Navajo loop trail...so much fun! It’s about a 1.2 mile loop. It’s much easier if you start the loop to the right (towards Wall Street) than the other way around. We didn’t have much time but would have loved to continue the trail into peek a boo or queens garden (all connect). A lot of shade around the trails but take water and expected to be dirty. Definitely take hiking shoes as rocks can be a bit slippery if you’re adventurous and like to climb."

It’s pristine with beautiful, thoughtfully-planned trails for hikers of all levels. We spent the better part of a full day here, just taking in the sweepingly-dramatic views with colors we have rarely seen in nature. We opted to hike; but bikers, horseback riders, and ATV enthusiasts will find it’s easy to book many tours of differing lengths and degrees of difficulty. We are passing through on our way to Yellowstone and only planned a couple of days at Bryce, but we will be back in the future to stay at least a week!"

     "comment": "Visited on a Sunday at the end of July. The park was not too crazy busy. The views around Sunrise Point and Sunset Point are the BEST! We also did the Queen's Garden, Navajo Loop, and portion leading to Wall Street trails. Simply stunning. I had read in previous reviews that the best lighting is in the early morning/around noon - and this was very true. As it got later in the day, the lighting was not as good for photos. If you are going on any of the hikes, be sure to wear hiking boots or tennis shoes with enough tread on them, as the trails can be steep and slippery without proper footwear. Also, bringing enough water is a must - at the higher elevation, you get tired more easily and the trails do not have a ton of shade - you will definitely need proper hydration! After we did the hikes, we drove the 18 miles down to the end of the park to Rainbow point, and then stopped at the scenic pull-outs on the way back. The drive and turn-out spots were beautiful, but the most impressive part of the park is the main Bryce amphitheater by Sunrise and Sunset Points. If you have a limited amount of time in the park, I would recommend skipping the drive and focusing on the hikes/viewpoints around the main amphitheater. The visitor center did have a nice gift shop - but if you're looking for snacks/drinks, those are located at the park general store. We did see several deer, as well, so be on the lookout for wildlife.\nOverall, Bryce Canyon exceeded my expectations (definitely up there with the Grand Canyon in terms of amazing scenery!). We had been at Cedar Breaks National Monument just before getting to Bryce Canyon, and Bryce Canyon is definitely more amazing (but totally worth stopping there as well, if time permits). If in the area it is a must see/do! Definitely doable in 1 day or 1/2 a day!"

The visitor is doing a good job of social distancing. There are indications on the floors regarding where to stand. In addition, many of the services such as maps, souvenirs, and help from the park rangers are also available outside.\nWe hiked two trails in addition to the rim walk. The Mossy Cave trail outside of the park was crowded, but for the most part, people were wearing masks. People on the Peekaboo trail were considerate and moved to the side or pulled up their masks, especially if we pulled ours up. It was crowded going back up to the rim and it was hard to avoid people due to the narrow path."

We took our self prepared dinner to the sunset point and watched an amazing sunset. The next day we spent 3 hours horseback riding through the entire canyon (sooo worth it for horse lovers!!!)\nI would come back to Bryce Canyon immediately!"

     "comment": "Another great National Park. There are unique geological formations here that are simply spectacular. There are numerous hiking opportunities within the park. We chose the Fairyland Loop one day (a good 5 hours and a serious workout), as well as the complete Navajo Loop Trail which is a must do experience while in Bryce.\nThe Visitor Center is recommended as a first stop for getting situated, obtaining recommendations for hikes that fit your level of fitness, as well as learning about any closures or things that may impact your stay at the time of your visit.\nThis is a place that affords ample opportunities for the photographer. Starting with the hoodoos, you’ll also see foliage up close, as well as wonderful panoramic vistas that stretch far and wide.\nA great treasure with well-maintained hiking trails. Highly recommended."

We spent from noon to 3:30 in the park driving to all the points and getting eyeful of views. We ate our sandwich lunch at Paria View then worked our way out to Yovimpa point. We swung into Inspiration Point and Sunset Point just before leaving, and were still in awe. It was hot with a great breeze that kept us in check. There was a park ranger talking to a small group at Yovimpa Point and everyone kept their distance. From here we drove through Zion to LaVerkin for two nights."

     "comment": "We arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park on our tour of National Parks of the Southwest.\nWe arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park and planned what we do for the afternoon that we were there. Since we only had a few hours at the park, we went over the different trails available that run along the canyon. The heat of 100+ degrees in July and the elevation at 8100 ft. had some impact on our choice of trail to do.\nThere is a shuttle system within the park to get to various locations without having to drive and park. There is a guide for the various hiking routes with their distance, time, and level of difficulty to help one decide what trail to use.\nWe chose a 1.5 mile hike along the Rim Trail overlooking the canyon starting at Bryce Point and ending at Sunset Point. It was relatively flat, and even with the heat and altitude, it was an east walk to get several perspectives of the Canyon.\nThe highlight of Bryce Canyon are the so called “hoodoo” formations that are pinnacle like structures eroded from the sandstone. We were able to see such features as Thors Hammer and Wall Street, as well as some of the trails down below in the canyon that would have been interesting has we more time at the park.\nFollowing our hike, we ate at a quick serve eatery next to The Lodge and Restaurant and had a little time for souvenirs at the large gift/souvenir shop.\nIt was a beautiful, cloudless sky, and ideal for our short visit to view this picturesque canyon and its interesting rock formations."

My suggestion is to do all of the hiking first on one day. Day 2 go see a sunrise at sunrise point. Then drive all the the way to the end of the road without stopping. Do the bristle cone loop trail there, and then start the drive back to the entrance stopping at the view points on the way back. 2 full days was enough for us but some people may choose to spend more. Don't miss this beautiful NP."

Stayed the day...make sure you stay to see Sunset Point late in the day as it’s beautiful. And maybe see a jay, prairie dog or antelope, like we did :)"

     "comment": "Amazing, out of this world gorgeous views! Layer your clothes as temperature fluctuates greatly depending on the time of day and where you are in the canyon. If you want a stamp in your national parks passport hit the visitor center early otherwise the wait can be long due to restrictions on the number of people permitted at one time. If it’s bathrooms and souvenirs you want, the lodge in town has an amazing selection. We hiked the 1.3 mile Navajo loop and LOVED it! It was definitely worth getting into the canyon. Wear hiking shoes, bring water and snacks and plan to take it slow due to the incline. I’d suggest going down towards Two Bridges first so you can come up the more gradual switchbacks through Wall Street. Beautiful, breathtaking views. So glad we visited! No lines to get in and parking was not an issue at any of the pullouts in the early part of June since reopening after Covid-19 shutdown."

     "comment": "I visited Bryce Canyon about a dozen years ago and vowed to return. On my second more recent trip there, my wife and I again hiked into the canyon and did the Navaho Trial though Wall Street and then came up the Queens Garden Trail on our return. It took us a very leisurely 2 1/2 hours. Being in our mid to upper 60's and considering the elevation of over 8,000 feet, I would advise avoiding a hike during the heat of the day. My wife is in excellent shape but being on a beta blocker, she had difficulty ascending the hike back up. For most people in reasonable shape this is a very manageable hike. I got up before sunrise both of our mornings and Sunset Point is spectacular at sunrise. The two trails we hiked feature spectacular scenery of the famous rock formations called hoodoos. Peekaboo Loop looks even more awesome but is a much more demanding and lengthier hike. As there are limited options in and around Bryce, I would highly recommend staying at the Bryce Lodge for convenience and value. But you have to book the property way in advance to get the dates you want. I think an arrival in the afternoon followed by one full day and one more morning is the perfect amount of time if you want to hike into the canyon. (2 nights) We went in mid to late September which was perfect. I'm guessing late May to mid June would be equally good timing as the nights can get cold even in May and September. We've been to all of the national parks in Utah and Arizona. Bryce is the gem of them all. Hiking below and along the hoodoos watching them change colors is simply awesome and unforgettable."

The hoodoos formation here is quite unique, not common in other national park, I think the scenery here is even better than those in Grand canyon, much better than in Zion, of course they are different styles, you will see different geology in different parks, but this is certainly the one you don't want to miss it."

We went mid March, dress in layers but be prepared to start shedding them as you hike if your going in the cooler months. It started out at 39 degrees but jumped to the mid 50’s during the hike. Also be prepared, plenty of water, snacks and good hiking shoes. We encountered snow on the trails which was expected in March but just come prepared. Views were incredible, each turn on a trail had us saying the views just keep getting better and better. Restrooms available and gift shop and small restaurant at one of the buildings. We did Peek-A-Boo trail which was 3 miles but total hike to get to Peek-A-Boo was about 6.85."

We spent a day here hiking many different trails, we found it awesome that one of the trails still had snow - and a lot of it. It was so much fun falling in the snow unexpectedly - we laughed so hard so many different times from our falls. I never thought I would see a place like this with my own eyes, it was so hard to hike with the simple fact that I just wanted to stand there and take in the beauty at every turn. We ended up skipping dinner to stay and watch the sunset and watch the stars come out, there were so many stars and you can see the milky-way which was pretty neat. If you are deciding between Zion and Bryce because you cannot do both my thoughts are this - for hiking Zion is better but from a majestic/picturesque standpoint Bryce wins!"

     "comment": "Bryce views never disappoint, but winter is another level of beauty! In addition to the beautiful easy access driving through the park and stopping at overlooks, we also brought our snowshoes (although they can be rented locally...or even supplied for free if you take one of the ranger-led tours.) We snowshoed on a few of the trails, and even \"off-trail\" on one of the ridges overlooking the vista. Our favorite was the Bristlecone Pine trail. We hardly EVER saw another person on any of our hikes this time of year. The contrast of the brilliant blue sky with the vermillion of the sandstone features, all contrasted with pristine white snow was spectacular. Then add in the green of the ancient bristlecone pines, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Another event we attended was the telescope presentation (once a week during winter, more often during peak seasons). It was worth the night time trip back into the park as we viewed the Orion Nebula, Venus, distant galaxies and more. My favorite part of that experience was having the staff point out and name various constellations, which I do not have the imagination to pick out myself. This winter visit was a long-time wish and we are glad we went. FYI the overlooks on the main road are very accessible for any ability (and many who are disabled.)"

Inspiring ! We drove up the mountain on the well maintained paved road, stopping at every viewing spot along the way. We did some walking and some stair climbing for better views, but this park is for everyone and anyone. Many of the views can be appreciated without ever geting out of your vehicles. Minimal walking is required for a better view from the lookouts. There are free bus shuttles if you prefer to not drive at all. Or, for the real dedicated hiker, you can hike the trails following close to the rim, from one lookout to the next until you reach the top, and then take the shuttle back down to your parked vehicle. Dress warm and in layers as the temperature can vary at higher altitude (8,900ft) The scenery is amazing with magnificent colors. Bryce Canyon National Park was our Highlight spot for 2019. HANDS DOWN the best by far."

In my opinion, it is more beautiful than the Grand Canyon. Hiking among the Hoodoos is easy and exhilarating. At least half a day is required but you can easily spend more time at this natural wonder. Drive all the way to the end of the scenic park road (the only one) and work your way back. That way all the turnoffs and scenic points and lookouts will be on your right hand side, making it easy ti enter and leave. This is a Must See attraction."

Although it was beautiful we really didn’t bring the proper hiking shoes nor equipment. I actually brought some really cute summer dresses and sandals to wear in the warm weather that didn’t even come out of my bag.\nSomeone took the time to make a little snow people, one even had a stick for its little snow dog, they were so dang cute!\nI feel blessed that I was able to go to two national parks on my journey back from California to Colorado. Now I must go back in the summer time to go to the places I really wanted to hike."

It was windy when we were there, but we enjoyed the hikes. Sad I didn’t see any prairie dogs! The only drawback was that the bathrooms at the end of the drive to Rainbow needed to be cleaned more regularly or at least checked on that day! There are multiple bathrooms up there; however, my spouse and I both came out of separate ones with the same opinion and heard others remarking of the same as they came out of others. We didn’t let this bother us though since the park itself was great!"

Our group was surprised that although limited we were able to thoroughly enjoy Sunset Point, hike several great trails, and enjoy great views like Wall Street, Inspiration Point, and others. Bryce Canyon hoodoos covered with beautiful light Utah snow are very special and worth every penny of the $35 entry fee. We had just come from Zion and actually enjoyed the deeper snow, different geology, and geomorphology of Bryce. The area outside Bryce on Route 63 has a few tacky outside-of-the-park attractions. Springdale, Utah outside of Zion provides nicer facilities than the area outside of Bryce. Best time of year to enjoy both is probably mid fall or late spring. Plan to spend at least two days at each. There's lots to see, do, and hike in both parks."

     "comment": "When pushed hard, I would probably pick Bryce above Grand Canyon or Zion ... because it is so unique and so mesmerizing. In any case, they are fairly close together, all in the same geological setting and make for a good week trip together.\nBryce Canyon is not really a Canyon but a large erosional feature in the uppermost step of the Escalante staircase of the broken-up Colorado plateau .. also for the geological layman the difference with a Canyon is clear since the cliff is essentially one-sided. The easygoing rim trail gives walking distance access to the most important viewpoints, and notably sunset point and sunrise point which are close together. By walking the Navajo trail from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point (or vice versa) one has immediate access to the Amphitheatre itself and can get up close and personal with the Hoodoos. If you do one thing in Bryce beyond walking the rim, it should be walking the Navajo trail, maybe combined with Wall Street.\nWe found the Lodge inside the park excellent accomodation also in Winter (close January and February though). Crawling distance from the rim which makes it easy to visit Sunset and Sunrise points at the right times of the day. Dinner is a 15 minute drive to e.g. Bryce Canyon Pines (recommended) in Bryce Canyon City just outside the National Park."

The wranglers were friendly and also let us know what we needed to do to stay safe on the ride. The scenery from the trails was breathtaking! I do have to say that at times those turns were tight on steep terrain so I just trusted the horse! It was truly a once in a lifetime experience! I would highly recommend this adventure!\nBryce Canyon itself is incredible! We drove to the highest point and stopped at all the outlooks on the way down, then we hopped on the tourist bus to do a few more!!\nWe went back at night, the views without any light pollution was unbelievable, almost forgot how incredible the Milky Way is to observe.\nLove this National Park!!!"

Unfortunately, there was a cold spell at the time, and we were viewing the sites in the early morning in mid-teen temperatures. Throw in the wind chill and an elevation of (8000'-9000'), and it was cold. Most of the popular viewpoints are centered around the hoodoo amphitheater (see photos). This is essence of Bryce Canyon National Park. This is where the exciting hiking and horse trails are located, and where you will find the most awesome land features. They is a vast array of hiking opportunities, both easy and difficult. We watched a film in the visitors center (22 minutes) that gave a very general overview of the park's history. We stayed at the Best Western near the park entrance which afforded us quick access. There are restaurants near the entrance to the park."

Did the shuttle all the way back to where we parked at lodge and had been told to drive your own car to the end. Well that was a great recommendation, as you could stop at your leisure without long walks to viewpoints in that altitude. We drove all the way to the end and boy was it worth it. Highly recommend to just drive it yourself."

Yes it was a little bit unclear were you need to go to, but the visitors center is a must and will give you the necessary pointers. From the visitors center car park it is possible to walk into the canyon, but we found it better to move your car up to Sunset point. Yes there are lots of cars and tour buses but we had no issues parking. Here it is a short walk to the Rim Trail. Our first view out into the canyon just blew us away. Amazing!! Stunning ... there's not enough words to describe the place. Move away from the busy areas and you will we rewarded. /We chose to walk the North Rim Trail around to Bryce Point where we then descended in to the Canyon on the Peek-a-boo Trailhead. Yes you need to be well prepared and have a good level of fitness as the walk down to the canyon floor is often steep and winding, but you are rewarded at every turn because the views are stunning. It just keeps on getting better, you think you've seen the best but then you turn the next corner and.... Be careful it's dangerous in places and take plenty of water and have the correct footwear. We saw plenty of people badly prepared and some taking big risks. The canyon floor is a long way down, it's worth it, but remember you have to climb back up to the car parks....\nStunning Place....."

     "comment": "We enjoyed a few days in Bryce Canyon National Park. We came from Capitol Reef so we ended up hiking the Mossy cave trail before getting to the Park's proper entrance. Once we arrived we started at the visitor center, they have some interactive displays, a really nice gift store and an informative movie. We opted to start the next day with the scenic drive to try to beat some of the crowds and it worked perfectly. TIP: For the scenic drive, go all the way to the end Yovimpa point, then stop at each lookout on your way back. All the lookouts are on the left side of the road so if you do them all on your way back you are not having to cross traffic, easy in and out and by starting at the end we were by ourselves at several lookouts. Lots of great hiking in this park. The elevation may impact some people. I also thought the rating of the hikes was not accurate, especially given the elevation. Seemed like some of the easy should be listed as more moderate. Queens Garden is the least steep to get into the Caynon but it is still steep."

We drove the scenic drive upon arrival one afternoon after studying the park brochure and map from the ranger's station. We got out at every stop on the map! Took pix and did some hikes which were wonderful! Highly recommend hiking the Bristlecone Trail at the last stop out on the point as well as hiking down either Sunrise or Sunset Points to the valley and also checking out Inspiration Point hike, all easy to moderate. Remember water, sun hat, sunglasses, and good shoes with traction when hiking in southern Utah! So the special things about Bryce include the hoodoos, the pine trees, the light colored stone, and the free shuttles (Zion has them too). You gotta go!"

We saw the night sky through three telescopes as part of park ranger experience (get there early, too). There are multiple trail options - some along the canyon rim and many into the basin. The hoodos are quite remarkable. We also took 3 hour free guided bus tour (tickets and boarding at the main shuttle station) to Rainbow Point with an experienced guide as we stopped at multiple sights coming and going. He spoke about the development of formations and pointed out some interesting formations we likely would have missed. Worth the three days we spent there."

You must make reservations in advance by phone or purchase tickets at Ruby's Inn. The tour shuttle leaves from Bryce City. We arrived midday so we took the 1:30 PM tour which was excellent. April was our guide, a local teacher and rancher who educated us and told many, wonderful stories. Do note that you will not see some of the recommended views on the tour but it is well worth it to get an overview and still see a ton. We went back a 2nd day to see and walk trails at Bryce, Inspiration, & Sunset Points. All the views are different and it was so clear you could see 100 miles!"

September is a great month to visit due to cooler weather & less number of people visiting/walking within the Park & it's trails! Free refillable bottle water stations is available through out the Park. The Park employees were very helpful when suggesting which trials were less strenuous & easier to walk/navigate even if one uses a cane! Another Plus at this Park are their free SHUTTLES from their multiple parking lots to the main Park Trial Heads!"

Their geology is interesting, but it is amazing just to view all the shapes and colors. There are a number of overlooks for viewing the canyon. This is our fifth visit to the park, and it is still breathtaking. There are lots of people and limited parking, but you can take a park bus from the visitor center."

But you can reserve a free tour that will take you all the way out to Rainbow Point, and will include a tour guide who will tell you all about the park and the surrounding area. It's a three hour tour, given twice a day and costs nothing. Call or stop by the Shuttle station just outside the park to reserve. Definitely hike along the Rim Trail and see all of the main points--Bryce, Sunset, Sunrise--but also take some time to get below the rim. The Navajo loop is 500ft down and up, but it's worth the climb to get a completely different view of the hoodoos. Even if you only go part of the way, it's worth getting down into the canyon."

We took the shuttle to Bryce Point, walked around and then shuttled to Inspiration Point, both lower and upper. This is a rather steep incline, but well worth it. We then walked to Sunset and Sunrise points and caught the shuttle back to the visitors center. We then drove to Rainbow Point, at the end of the park, with very little traffic. This allowed for sunset views with far less people than the other points. I highly recommend the shuttle system to save parking hassles and to save a lot of time."

Each stop was more amazing than the last and we just loved it. Our final stop was the Sunset overlook and it was absolutely amazing. If you have the ability to hike this would make an amazing hike down in the canyon between the spired rock formations. If you are going to UT to see the amazing rock formations, this park is a must see."

I could actually get parking at most viewpoints, But, I would highly recommend using the Bryce shuttle that you boards in the town outside of Bryce NP. All the viewpoints on the regular shuttle are worth stopping at and the shuttle comes by every 10-12 min. You can also hike allow the canyon rims to the next stop. There is also a special free park shuttle at 9am & 130pm with a tour guide that takes you down the other road to rainbow point for a 3+hr ride, but you have to signup for this with 48 hrs of the departure, great tour. some of those viewpoints are crowded for parking."

     "comment": "The starting point for a visit should be the Visitor Center. Here you will find information at the Ranger Help Desk, exhibits, a 22-minute film and maps and souvenirs.\nBryce is not a single canyon unlike say the Grand Canyon. It is a series of huge amphitheatres carved into a high plateau. They are huge and are filled with irregularly eroded spires of rock called hoodoos. Bryce contains the largest concentration of hoodoos in the world.\nOver two million visitors come to Bryce National Park each year, most in the March to October period. Every visitor spends at least some time marvelling at the views from the four main viewpoints and walking the trails between them. I strongly suggest the 1.6 kilometer paved trail along the edge of the amphitheatre between Sunset and Sunrise Points. Then you need to venture down into the hoodoos via the Navajo Loop Trail or the Queens Garden Trail.\nAccommodation within the park is limited to the rustic Lodge at Bryce Canyon and the North and South campgrounds which are near the Lodge and the Visitor Center."

And what a sight ... from sorts of perspectives, views of magically colored cliffs and formations , spited, cut-out curtains of eroding rock. There are trails heading upward from the forested rim, or down, if you dare, into the canyon. The colors change with the light. My little granddaughter loves the hoodoos - the eroding formations that wind up looking like rock statues. Summer rains, freezing at night and expanding cracks in the rock, help erode these formations rapidly as geology goes. We tried out several moderate walks with stunning views. Bryce is not as crowded as Zion, but you still need to plan at least 6 months in advance for lodging. If you go to any Utah parks, make sure you see this one, too!"

     "comment": "I have never in my life seen anything as beautiful as the hoodoos in Bryce Canyon! It will absolutely take your breath away! A nice quick hike from Sunup Point to Sundown Point will give you a gorgeous view of the natural formations. There is also a good day hike down to the bottom and back up again. A great place for families to enjoy the views!"

The park itself is gorgeous. No need to rent a four wheeler, helicopter, or half dead horse. Get out and enjoy up close. Tour as much as you are able to while you can. Lots of sights are very close to the bus stops. Leave your car in town and don’t waste time looking for parking spots in the park. We saw lots of 70 and 80 year olds enjoying the sights. Lots of geology in the Big 5 so try to get on a Ranger Lead Tour for the best inside information. Make sure to visit the Visitor Center for the movie. Enjoy!"

That way, we didn't have to fight for a parking spot at either the visitors center or at any of the scenic overlooks. Plus the shuttle is free so why not!!\nSpeaking of scenic overlooks, the park is rich with magnificent views at every stop. If you HAVE to chose to only go to a few of our national parks, make sure Bryce is on your list."

     "comment": "We were at Bryce Canyon National Park on this late September Sunday and the park was busy. We used a National Parks Pass that allowed us to enter Bryce Canyon National Park for free. The regular price is $30 per vehicle.\nOur first stop was the Ranger Station/ interpretive Centre which is about 100 yards pass the entrance on the right. There is no parking here. You will have to do a short drive pass the centre, turn left and park in the lot and a short walk back to the centre.\nSunset Point and the Rim Trail were our first stops after the info centre. Sunset Point has the short paved Rim trail hike near the parking lot. The trail is similar to the Grand Canyon Rim trail hike on a paved trail but much shorter.\nQueens Garden Trail\nWe started on the Queens Garden trail (to the left on the Rim Trail) going clockwise on a gentle downhill. The trail here is mostly compact dirt and gravel with some exposed rocks. There is a lot of amazing scenery of the rock formations with lots of photo ops. One of the highlights here is the Queen Victoria formation, a rock formation that looks that looks like her profile.\nNavajo Loop Trail\nAdjoining the Queens Garden Trail is the Navajo Loop Trail. We joined the trail and hiked up the “Wall Street” trail. This trail is through a canyon “slot” with steep walls on both sides. The trail itself is compact dirt and gravel with some man-made steps and short switchbacks near the top. The hardest part of the trail is going up, about a 1/4 - 1/3 mile climb. It may be difficult for those with mobility and / or cardio issues but not impossible. We joined the Navajo Loop trail part way through the Queens Garden Trail and missed the Thors Hammer rock formation. Our loop of the trail was about (Queens Garden and partial Navajo Loop) was about 5 kilometers / 3.1 miles. If you want to do the complete Navajo Loop Trail and go downhill to start (probably the easier option), go to Sunset Point and start with “Wall Street” section.\nInspiration Point\nAt Inspiration Point there are 3 viewpoints with the first one being paved and closest to the parking lot. There are very short hikes, maybe 200-300 meters, for the next 2 viewpoints on a compact dirt and gravel trail. There are washrooms and a bus stop here. Inspiration Point has parking for about 60 cars.\nBryce Point\nBryce Point has a short paved trail with parking for about 75 cars. This is also a bus shuttle stop. There are some nice views and worth a 15-20 minute stop.\nNatural Bridge Viewpoint has parking for 40+ vehicles and is worth a 5-10 minute stop.\nAgua Canyon Viewpoint has parking for about 12 vehicles and is worth a 5 minute stop.\nRainbow Point is at the end of all the sites. There are parking spots for 100 plus vehicles and there are washrooms here. There is a short paved trail that offers views of the Canyon. We headed off to the right and the Bristlecone loop, an out and back with a loop about 1.6 km (1 mile) in length. The trail consists of mostly compact dirt and gravel. From the first lookout to the second one is uphill and about 200 meters.\nIf you have visited the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon National Park is comparable and even better according to my fellow hikers; not because of the size but the fact you are walking on the canyon floor with amazing rock formations surrounding you.\nI would rate the overall experience 5 out of 5.\nNotes &Tips:\n• At the interpretive centre there are washrooms and a gift shop. Pick up your park map here. Plan your visit on the internet before you get here so you’ll know in advance what you want to see.\n• The park “drive” is basically an out and back route on a paved road with our first “Point” being Sunrise and the last one being Rainbow / Yovimpa. There were a few other viewpoints that we did not stop at\n• In total we spent about 6-7 hours in the park\n• Bring suntan lotion and wear a hat. During the last week of September it was still hot and sunny.\n• I would recommend a good pair of trail runners or day hikers and definitely no flip-flops!\n• Pack a picnic lunch and bring water. There are picnic tables, washrooms and water near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Bryce Canyon Lodge has a restaurant.\n• There was a good mix of old and young people with lots of seniors (65+). Some people were using hiking poles but in my opinion they are not necessary depending upon your age.\n• Parking spots may be in short supply depending upon when you arrive and the time of the season. We were there during the last week of September and it was busy but were lucky to get a parking spot near Bryce Canyon Lodge and it was a very short walk to the Rim Trail. If the parking lot is full you will have to park in the overflow lots and take the free shuttle buses to the various viewpoints. The free shuttle buses stop at all the viewpoints throughout the park.\n• We saw Steller’s Jay birds and a chipmunk on our hikes\n• There are camp grounds inside the park\n• We were on our first day of our 13 day Nevada-Arizona-Utah trip. We were off to Moab and Goblin Valley next. Other national parks we visited on this trip included Arches, Canyonlands and Zion. See my reviews.\n• State and private parks we visited included Goblin Valley, Monument Valley, Lower and Upper Antelope and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. See my reviews.\n• Buy an annual pass if you plan to visit more than 3 national parks in the next 12 months."

There are many viewpoint and you really need to spend a day here to see as many as possible. You can drive your car through the park or take the free shuttle.\nTrying to narrow down which are the best viewpoints is difficult but the general consensus is that the first four (Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce) are must sees. I would also recommend Rainbow, Natural Bridge and Fairyland.\nZion is great too but honestly if you could only visit one of them I would pick Bryce over Zion."

     "comment": "We love visiting national parks and Bryce is certainly one of our favorites. The canyon itself can be seen almost entirely from the comforts of the car . There is an 18 mile scenic drive which take you to all of the points. Our favorites were Inspiration Point, Natural Bridge, Ponderosa , and Bryce Point. This drive took us 3-4 hours with plenty of photo stops and short hikes along the rim.\nEven though you can see the park by car, we highly recommend taking at least a couple of hikes along the well maintained trails. Some suggestions if you are short on time like us :\n1. Navajo trail ( our favorite): moderate, at least see the first few sections and switchbacks.\n2. Rim trail : easy\n3. Queens Garden : easiest descent into the canyon, but we liked the Navajo descent more.\nNavajo and Queens Garden can be combined to do a loop.\nThe highlight of the trip was the night sky . We cannot recommend this enough. Please go to one of the points , and just look up. You will see the glorious milky way and a million stars.\nAll in all, we highly recommend this park."

We ignored the advice to take the shuttle bus, and used the GyPSy app with our car. This app used GPS to coordinate what the narrator was saying and what we were looking at. We were given directions for our travel once we neared the park, and told what order would be best for viewing. You may be led to believe that you must do hiking as part of your experience. While hiking could well make a better experience, just viewing is other wordly and quite spectacular."

The bus picked you up from any of 15 points and took you in a loop to the most prominent places like Bryce and Inspiration Points, Sunrise and Sunset Points, as well as the Lodge, VIsitor Centre and the various hotels in the area.\nThee Visitor Centre will give you directions to get the best of your time here. There are ranger programs. The Bryce Amphitheatre Rim has the best views and you can go hiking inside on several different trails. Or you can do the scenic drive which is 18 miles long on your own or on the free 3 hr Rainbow Bus Tour but for this you need reservations.\nWe saw some amazing rock formations, thousands of hoodoos and sandstone cliffs that have eroded over 70 million years to give you an awesome spectacle."

We also visited Inspiration Point and Sunset Point with the shuttles. One of the things I noticed about Bryce was how accessible it is. We are not disabled, but I noticed that nearly all of the viewpoints had paved areas and parking very close to the viewpoints for those with mobility issues. I loved it. I felt so lucky that I was able to attend an astronomy program after dark at the lodge and then do a telescope viewing of our planets and galaxies at Sunset Point. The rangers were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable during this. I could have talked to them all night. We also especially loved the rangers directing traffic at the visitors center. You could tell they all genuinely loved their jobs. I'll definitely be back!"

We were lucky to be there for both a full moon, and when the moon rise was at the same time as sunset."

     "comment": "This is a must visit beside Zion NP. It's just a couple hours drive from Zion via the beautiful Hwy 9 Zion Scenic Drive and Hwy 89, with so many winding roads and unbelievable views of Zion NP. Don't forget to take some pictures with a couples of drive-thru Arches before reaching Bryce Canyon NP entrance.\nThere are 4 main viewpoints: Bryce point, Inspiration point, Sunset point and Rainbow Point. IMO, a MUST SEE are Bryce Point and Rainbow Point.\n- At the Bryce Point you can view the famous Bryce Amphitheater (it carries the park's name, so most of the highlights are here), whereas countless spires of rock columns also called Hoodoos that carved into the canyon, they formed into an unbelievable views, an unbelievable place on earth. So unique and mind-boggling.\n- Rainbow Point is the last viewpoint of the park, it's also at the highest elevation (9,115' to be exact). The panoramic view of the whole Bryce canyon is here. It's just BREATHTAKING. Trust me. You don't want to miss this.\n- FYI, if you like to hike, there are trails in each viewpoint, they also have trails that connect between viewpoint, ranging from easy to moderate. Spend at least a day at the park to enjoy all the best that Mother Nature has given us.\nHope this review will help you with some basic info. Now, go explore and enjoy one of the Mighty Five."

Most of it can be seen without a guided tour, which is what we did. Went up to the end of the road and worked our way back, which was a great way to beat the crowds. Once back at the visitors center, there is a shuttle that will take you to the parts you can't see by car, and the run frequently.\nThe vistas a views are literally other-worldly. If you want to know what a canyon would look like on anther planet, you don't need to imagine it, as you can see one of Mother Nature's true spectacles, right here on Earth. The pictures shown on the web, pale in comparison to the awe and majesty of this place. DON'T WAIT, GO!"

Trail gets you INTO the Canyon, a sense of slot canyons, twisted trees, etc. I have a great fear of heights, but this trail was fine. Well surfaced, but not a wheelchair granny trail. After the trail, drive to end of park road, enjoying several scenic stops. One could spend one or several days here. Noted a nice, long bike trail outside the park. Also an extraordinary state park with intense red formations outside park."

     "comment": "We just returned from 3 wonderful and amazing days in Bryce Canyon! Arriving in late afternoon, we started our experience at Bryce with the Mossy Cave hike and a visit to Fairyland. The following day to get a scope of the park, we did the 18 mile scenic view points, and the Ampitheatre (Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise, and Bryce Points). The next morning, when crowds were low, we did the Wall Street hike from Sunset Point to the Queens Garden, up to Sunrise Point, and back to Sunset. We followed this with a sunset hike from Sunset Point, down Wall Street, and did the Navajo Loop. The incredible formations, Thor's Hammer and the 3 Sisters, can be viewed at the end of this loop. We highly recommend the Rustler's Restaurant in Tropic. Not only is the food great, but owner, Dallas Clark, is the first genuine cowboy that we have met. He heards 250 head of cattle that he has raised from Tropic to Page every November through back country."

They will drop you off to take pictures, hike, and etc. Shuttles run every so many minutes. I bet I took over a hundred pictures. We both throughly enjoyed it."

Spend some time, especially at sunrise and sunset to view the changing light and colors on the hoodoos. Bryce Canyon is famous for its worldly unique geology. The erosional force of frost-wedging and the dissolving power of rainwater have shaped the colorful limestone rock of the Claron Formation into bizarre shapes including slot canyons, windows, fins, and spires called “hoodoos.” When we were there we took a horseback ride into the bottom of the canyon. Fabulous! We stayed in the historic cabins close to the rim. Highly recommend!"

Fortunately, the Navajo Loop trail was reopened in June so you could descend into the canyon - go early in the day for the most amazing experience. For those who are challenged, the paved path from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point is easy to maneuver. The rim trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point and then to Sunset Point, also provides outstanding views. If you do use the bus system, they only go as far as Bryce Point. To see the complete park, you will need to drive your own vehicle. They do offer extended tours (check the schedule at the Visitor's Center) and the drivers are quite knowledgeable about the area."

The only walk which is accesible with the stroller is between sunset and sunrise they say. But we did Queens garden, Navajo loop and sunset to inspiration point with the stroller as well. Sometimes a bit steep and stoney but as far as we’re concerned it was good (make sure you take the 2 bridges side of Navajo, we did the other side and than you do have to carry the last couple of hundred meters).\nWe stayed at ruby’s inn rv and the shuttle stops there as well so you can park and leave your rv.\nNb don’t go to inspirationpoint for sunset, it’s worthless for the sun is at the other side."

(Those are the pillar looking rock formations)\nThis park and generally all of the NP's we visited while in Utah, was kind of small. Not sure exactly how big but I think from.the entrance to the end, it was like 18 miles?\nFirst day we arrived, we took a ride all the way to the end and made our way back out. We didn't hike that day, just drove and stopped and took pictures.\nThe next day we hiked! We did the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail, through Wall St. What an incredible park this is. The views were other worldly. Just like at Zion NP, Bryce has some switchbacks. Make sure you bring some snacks and plenty of fluids with. Even being in the canyon, it gets warm out there.\nParts of the Queens Garden Trail went through the rock! They cut out little tunnels for you to go through. It was a really awesome place to hike. Probably our favorite.\nWe went down another trail, not sure of the name, but it took you past Thor's Hammer and other sites. We were dog tired by that point. Make sure to pay attention to the elevation gain for which ever trail you're doing.\nA good thing to do is to check in at the welcome center and talk with the rangers. They will give you valuable information.\nAll in all, can't wait to go back!"

We went during the day and it was pretty hot, but if you bring plenty of water and good shoes, you will be so enchanted. It's hard to get reservations in the park to stay, so for a summer vacation, book now for 2020 if you want to stay in the park or anywhere close to the entrance."

All downhill on two bridges path and back up on Wall Street. Hot and beautiful. Many stops for water anywhere we found shade. Loved this beautiful hike. Not easy but these 60 year old legs made it. Gorgeous."

I recommend to overnight in the Park (The Lodge at Bryce Canyon) as we did: two steps away from your room you can choose the best spot away from the crowds and admire this view (sunrise or sunset point). After breakfast we hiked Navajo Loop Trail, short and easy walk but with memorable views."

     "comment": "If you like to hike, Bryce is the place for you. There are so many different and varied hikes available, you will be busy for a long time just figuring out which hike to enjoy next.\nDuring the summer season Bryce does get crowded. Not as bad as Zion or Yosemite, but still very crowded. If you aren’t camping in the park, the really is no reason to fight the crowded parking lots found at the vistas and trailheads. An excellent bus shuttle system runs throughout the park and will get you anywhere you need to go. Park outside the park and hop on the shuttle, this saving your patience and preserving your peace of mind.\nFabulous pizza by the slice at the General Store. Huge and affordable , one slice is enough. Enjoy!"

George was our Park Ranger - and he was informative and entertaining. The park shuttle doesn't go to Rainbow Point, so unless you go in your own vehicle, this is the best way to get there. After arriving at Rainbow Point and taking in the view, you stop at several other viewing areas on the way back. There's a little bit of walking, but nothing strenuous - at most about 200 yards. And, the best part is that it's free (we gave George a nice tip, but that isn't necessary or even mentioned)."

     "comment": "We were in a small rv ( 20foot long) so were directed to park in the rv park to the right of the main visitor centre. We already had a National Parks annual pass so it did not cost us to get in or park. The pass costs $80 but well worth it if you plan to visit several of them. We dropped into the visitor centre but had already been given maps so quickly headed out to catch the free shuttle. You don’t have to do this but parking and navigating in the amphitheater can be difficult at peak times. We hopped off the bus at sunrise & walked the hoodoos to sunset point. It’s spectacular but can be hot so take water,suncream etc. We were limited in time but there are other trails that you can do. We then went back to the van for lunch before setting off on the scenic drive. We opted to drive to the furthest point & stop at the view points on the way back as it was easier to turn in/out.\nBest advice is to get there early & do any walking while still cool."

The formations are amazing, the exploration of the park is facilitated by shuttle buses that go to most places, the paved trails, the orientation movie at the Visitor Center, and last but certainly not least, the ranger talks. If you don't want to drive, you can park about 2 miles north of the park entrance on Hwy 63, then ride the shuttle into the main park area.\nMy photos are incredible, enhanced by the puffy white clouds that were in the beautiful blue sky all day. September after kids are back to school is a great time to visit--still warm, but not too hot. Also not too crowded."

The Rangers are very nice and provide excellent information about trails. The park is busy with tourists but most of them stay at the rim of the canyon. The short trails are crowded but the long and more strenuous are not so busy. I recommend to use the park bus since parking could be problematic.

There was a line to the first overlook, attendant waved us in, no spaces to park, no U turns, and fifty cars behind us probably got the same thing. I never got to see anything, as the road within the park is not at all revealing to the presence of anything but trees.\nAs a result, I opted not to drive any farther in the direction of a National Park. We skipped Zion and the Grand Canyon because this was the worst experience I've ever had in a park, the grand finale of bad experiences in a week of trying to tour the ones in Utah."

My family was truly enjoyed the guide tour.\nThe shuttle bus driver Randy was outstanding . He was storytelling the history of all the places we visited. We had seen the Bryce Ampitheater rock formation, Fairyland loop ,Tower bridge and others during the FREE guide Tour. The sites were WOW! We would had missed many scenic places if we drove ourselves.\nWe also drove along the Scenic Byway12 nearby. Red Canyon and Grand Staircase -Escalante had some breath taking views."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon National Park is a must when visiting the State of Utah.\nYou can drive through the park there is a nice paved road. I suggest that when entering the park drive right up to the end which is Yovimpa point. Reason for this is that the viewpoints are all to your right when driving down, so much easier to park your car. Each viewpoint is worth a stop as all are differend. The park is full of Hoodoos which are pinkish limestone columns. There are hiking trails, some accompanied by rangers to go down into the park. The one I liked most was the\n\"Queen's Garden\" (hoodoo like a statue of Queen Victoria.)\nMost of the walks from one viewpoint to another are proteced with fence but there\nare still some areas which are not. Be careful and don't go too near the edge."

     "comment": "This is one of my favorite national parks. Seeing all the glorious colors of the hoodoos is like no other place I've ever seen. Get there early in the summer to beat the crowds, even before the park officially opens, you can get in. Inspiration Point is amazing - do the walk to the point. The hike at Sunset Point Overlook is awesome. You travel down into the canyon and will walk between the huge red rock into what appears to be like a slot canyon. You'll then walk out of the more narrow area onto a trail that traverses through part of the canyon's floor and then takes you back up to Sunset Point again. Note, bring water; wear tennis shoes at the least, and if you are not used to climbing any elevation, just take it slowly. You'll get there. It's not a hard hike; just coming back up will give you some elevation. Lots of overlooks in the park and lots of trails if you have more time. Amazing place!"

You just have to go and be there to understand.\nIf you're wondering where to go and what to do, don't worry because the map they give you explains how long the walk is and how strenuous it is so you can alter it for your needs. In addition, the free shuttle buses are there to take you to most of the sites and the horse ride is also another option (extra cost). Lastly there's a special shuttle called the Rainbow shuttle that you need to reserve ahead of time and it's free with a ranger to guide you on your tour."

In order to access some of the viewpoints, you’ll need to hike up a moderately strenuous trail, but besides that, most of the scenic driving tour is a breeze."

They are spacious with two beds, a fireplace, and second wash basin across from the bathroom. The fireplace felt pretty good cutting the 44 degree morning temp in mid August. The cabins are a short walk to the rim and puts you up close and personal to the beauty."

This visit we hiked the Navajo trail down in the canyon and loved it!\nThe Navajo trail is just little over a one mile hike. So glad we did it. We were worried about the hike out of the canyon but it was not as bad as we thought. We went down on the Wall Street side and went up on the other side. The switch backs can be challenging however for 2 people not in excellent shape that are 51 & 60 it was not all that bad.\nThe views were totally different than from above and not at all what we expected. We were so glad we did this hike! Make sure to where comfortable walking shoes. Water might be needed on a hot day. The breeze in the canyon was great when we were there and the temp was 82 in mid August. Excellent weather for this hike. We barely broke a sweat."

     "comment": "Quite simply this place needs to be seen to be believed! Even my teenagers were struck speechless for a while! Advice is to go as early as you can to beat the crowds and the heat of the day. We arrived 9am.. drive to Sunset Point, walk North along the rim to Sunrise point & then follow the trail\ndownwards. Whole thing takes just over an hour if you take it slowly.\nIt’s a gentle slope down with stunning views. The reason to do the loop this way around is that it is easier to climb up a steep slope than to walk down down it. At the end of the loop you get 2 options.. zone to to climb back up to the right and the other is to go left towards Wall Street. Do this one! It’s steep but in the shade and stunning! Our sins did the other route since it was slightly shorter but they said it was sunny. No words describe how stunning this place is... here are some photos.\nThen drive along the very end of the park, Yovimba point. Don’t. Other stopping stand if the vistas on the way there; save that for the trip back when they’re all in the right hand side, so much easier to drive in and out of. It’s stunning!"

Choose a quieter time. We found it better to drive straight there and then work our way back through all the scenic stop off points.\nThe treks are a lot easier than we anticipated before we got there. We did the busy Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trail followed by the Tower Bridge trail which was much quieter. Park in the Sunset Car Park and take the stunning short walk to Sunrise Point to start either trek. The treks are amazing, a real lifetime experience.\nI would recommend taking picnics with you. Food in the Park is not great.\nCheck the weather as lightening can be quite dangerous. We saw a number of strikes around the top of the rim which, whilst spectacular, were quite scary.\nWell marked stop off points give you good views, many of which are surprisingly different.\nBryce Visitor Centre is extremely busy and the car park is a nightmare. Lots of unsupervised, over-excited children made it quite dangerous. Worth going to however as the Rangers are extremely helpful."

To see as much has you can, plan 2 plus days. Start early and stay out as long as possible. Stop at the visitor's center to get some ideas of what to see and do.\nIf you plan to hike down and up, be prepared. Plenty of water, hat, sunscreen, snacks, fan, light jacket, and good shoes. Make sure you plan time for it, as you want to enjoy the experience and look around and not just run up and down.\nThe unusual rock formation and scenic views all around you do not get much better than Bryce Canyon!"

We wanted to visit Zion as well (about an hour away) but did not have time to do both. I would highly recommend stopping to see."

     "comment": "Our first time visiting from the UK. No photos do this place justice. Pulling up to the visitor centre you feel like you are in a fairytale wilderness as wild deer roam the grasslands. Then the first time you look over 'the rim' to the hoodoos below - Mother Nature certainly carved a work of art!\nWould suggest driving all the way to the furthest point, Rainbow Point, and call in on a handful of vantage points on your way back (all are on your right on the way back). Finish off at Sunrise or Sunset point at the end of the day to see the sun falling below the horizon.\nWe walked part of the Queen's Garden Trail early one morning. Rated as one of the less strenuous hikes, if you are not reasonably fit you will find the hike back up quite hard. Go early in the morning and take plenty of water."

We went to every stop in the park over three days and never tired of the views! Very magical! Just wish they had a restaurant overlooking the beauty! Would be perfect! We rented a cabin in the pines between Bryce and Zion! Just spectacular everywhere we drove and both parks! And the drive to Vegas at the end of our week was just as amazing! Be very careful driving. Dear everywhere on the roads. I don’t recommend driving at night. Gorgeous skies at night! Bryce is a must for everyone who loves nature and the great outdoors!!!"

They do offer a free shuttle but decided to drive because of limited time. We went to the last stop the shuttle makes first and then worked out way back. In hindsight we should have started with the first shuttle stop and then gone forward because by the time we got there, there was no parking. Only problem with early morning is that the lighting for pictures isn't the greatest, but it is cooler and less crowded."

     "comment": "Bryce is stunningly beautiful!! Every view point has a slightly different view & the colors are amazing! I highly recommend \"hiking the hoodoos\" - it gives you a greater appreciation for Bryce. We hiked in at Sunset point & out at Sunrise point (this meant that the hiking back up was a little less intense). It was about 3-miles round trip (including the rim walk back from Sunrise point to Sunset point) and we did it with our two kids (ages 7 & 10). It took a little bit more encouragement to get the 7-year old back up to the rim, but they both made it! And we got cool stickers at the Visitor's Center when we showed them our pictures of us & the little \"Hike the Hoodoos\" medallions down in the canyon. Be sure to carry water & wear hiking clothes! Parking gets pretty full at some of the main sights, so you might want to enter the park earlier in the day or may later in the day. That being said, many of the viewpoints still had room to make our quick pull-ins & pull-outs. We spent the better part of the morning here, but we could easily have spent a lot longer!"

The hoodoos look like they are defying gravity and seeing them as far as the eye can see is a sight to behold. I went for a short hike from Sunset point to Sunrise point, which I think is a better way to experience the park than just seeing it from the view points.\nBe aware that Bryce, like all the other national parks I visited, is very crowded in summer.

     "comment": "The scenery in Bryce is unlike anywhere else--amazing rock formations, beautiful colors that change almost by the minute, great hiking trails, and unmatched stargazing at night. There are a half dozen hikes in each of the easy, moderate and strenuous categories just in and around the amphitheater alone, ranging from 1 mile to 8. And there are multi-day backcountry hikes as well as horseback options. And if all you can do is walk or ride a wheelchair around the paved part of the rim trail, you will count it amongs life's great experiences. At night the sky is so dark you will be blown away by how much you can see.\nI recommend starting at the Visitors Center and planning your day by viewing the scale topo model of the park. It's a much better preview than consulting a map since you can actually see the terrain you'll be hiking through."

     "comment": "We traveled to 9 national parks and for us the best one out of it was Bryce Canyon, UT.\nThe brillant colors of pink, gray, white, chocolate cliffs were a sight to see. The hoodoo delicate formations throughout Bryce is fascinating. We took a shuttle from visitor center to Bryce Point #3 - oh what a view. we walked 2 miles to Inspiration Point #4. As you walk from each point the views keeping changing magically to reshape what you just viewed a few steps away. Then we took the shuttle to #6 and walked a mile to #8 Sunset Point, again viewing different angles of the hoodoo and spirals. The hoodoos keep breaking off and new ones begin. The colors are magnificent and breathtaking.. After we finished seeing all the four points we waited to take a free ranger tour at 1:30. This is a three hour tour our ranger guide Randy, was awesome.\nyou can register for a free tour guide up to 7 days before you arrive and make an appointment either at 9:00 am or 1:30 pm. They only take 40 people so you can imagine it fills up quickly. I just called 7 days ahead and made the appointment.\nHere is where he took us: Rainbow Point, Yovimpa Point where Randy explained each stop with passion. Then he took us to Aqua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Faiirview Point, again just explaining the beauty of the Hoodoos. He took us to Fairyland Point where he showed us Snoopy sleeping on the Hoodoo. Actually you can give names to any Hoodoo and call it as you see it. I recommend taking this tour but register 7 days ahead to assure a sit."

We rented a house just outside the Park entrance (10 minutes from the Visitor Center), and it was convenient and relaxing to enter the Park each day and see the sites.\nThere were a couple of accessible walks for young children and family members with limited mobility, and there was a fairly easy walk that led down into the Canyon for unique photographs.\nThere are a couple of different options in the park for meals, and there are also restaurants within 10 - 20 minutes from the Park entrance. The general store has a surprisingly large selection (food, hiking and first aid supplies, souvenirs, etc.) and bathrooms are easy to find throughout the park (helpful with kids).\nWe found Bryce to be a much more pleasant experience than Zion Canyon -- not as crowded, easier to get around in the Park (no shuttle needed), more variety of hikes/walks for people with different fitness levels, and not as hot in July. We would love to return.\nWe spent 2 days and could have spent longer.\nOnly suggestion would be for Rangers to set up / host designated dark areas for people to gather for stargazing (away from the Visitor Center)."

They run through the “amphitheatre” - the basin form of the canyon and are in stripes of colour from the deepest browns and reds to pale golds.\nThe National park is extremely well run. There is no access to the many view points into the canyon for RVs, but you can park up and there is an efficient hop-on, hop-off bus service that runs a route around these vistas. Buses come every 10-minutes or so.\nYou will never have seen anything like this. Make sure you visit if you’re nearby."

After checking in at our hotel last Monday, we drove to the park entrance, paid the $35 fee, and drove in. Fortunately, traffic in the park was light. We stopped at 10 viewpoints and took pictures and hiked a bit. The canyon is just as beautiful and majestic as I recall from so many years ago!"

You can earn a free park sticker at the visitors center if you take a selfie in front of the hoodoo boards marked throughout the park. Ask for details when you arrive. It is a good way to keep kids motivated to hike!\nLunch at Bryce Lodge is a good idea, but service is sketchy. If you get the right server, you are in luck.Tasty lunch buffet.\nWe stayed at the Mountain Ridge Cabins in Hatch, just 30 minutes away from the entrance to BCNP. Perfect spot for us!\nGood family biking options in and out of the park."

     "comment": "Of all the places our family visited in southern Utah, Bryce is the most unique. There are the ubiquitous red and white sandstone cliffs, but at Bryce they are wind and water sculpted into fantastic shapes and towers. After visiting the visitor center and speaking to a ranger, park your car and take the free shuttle; they are easy, convenient and allow you to take in the scenery. As a plus, the drivers are a wealth of knowledge they gladly share. Based on our conversation with the bus driver, we decided to hike the Rim Trail from Inspiration Point past Sunset Point to Sunrise Point. We then hiked into the canyon by the Queen's Garden Trail to Navajo Loop (Wall Street side, Two Bridges was closed). Hiking in that direction, as suggested by the visitor center ranger, we were mostly in the sun for the walk down into the canyon but had some shade on the way out. It is a moderate hike, around 4 miles, that took us (a 60-ish couple with bad feet and knees and 3 others around 30 year olds) several hours, but we were in no hurry and there is a lot to look at. You are walking down into the canyon (and then up and out) so there are some high areas, which doesn't thrill me, but they were manageable, and the payoff scenery was more than worth it. As you approach the switchback ascent from the canyon, enjoy the coolness, literally and figuratively, of Wall Street. Be sure to bring plenty of water and some insect repellent. If you are coming to Bryce via Rt 14 from Cedar City, be advised there is a stretch of road that is narrow, twisty and has sheer and often guard rail-less drop-offs. Bryce seemed much less crowded than Zion and different than anyplace you've ever been in the US."

I took a shuttle to Bryce Point, Inspiration point,sunset point, Sunrise pt and then hiked Queen's garden trail. It wasn't a long or difficult hike - it's pretty smooth hike.

So many natural wonders. The trails are well-marked. The park offers a shuttle service that picks up every 15 minutes at each of the trail entrances so if you had limited time or wanted to hike a portion of a trail rather than all of it, this will definitely come in handy.\nBring a snack and don't forget your water - there's a LOT to see and explore here!"

Allow at least most of the day and if you are fit and able take a walk down to the canyon floor as the perspective totally changes. We stayed nearby and used the shuttle buses. They are free and go very ten minutes from each of the viewing spots. There are various hiking trails depending on your fitness . The rim trail is fairly easy and obviously goes around the rim where again the whole view can change very quickly. The park is clean , well maintained and the staff helpful\nThere is a nice pizza and salad hut at the Bryce Lodge stop, which is halfway around the stops, so a good place to stop for lunch.

The regular shuttle doesn’t go all the way to Rainbow Point so there are no hordes from ‘you know where’ shoving you out of the way to take their selfies.\nWe did think that $35 for the day was expensive. Sure you could come back again but there’s no need. It’s not Yellowstone.\nThe very small car park at Bryce Point was manned by a couple of thugs who wouldn’t let you reverse nor wait for us to get in our car to let another car into our space. Were they trained to be unpleasant, did they miss being in the military or was it just a requirement of the job?\nDidn't spoil our visit, as hard as they tried. Beautiful!"

The rock formations will never stop to amaze and on the longer hikes there are not many people, just enough to share your experience and have an occasional chat. Of course the hikes are tough because you have to go back uphill after descending into the canyon, but with good boots and a reasonable level of fitness they are all doable. No special skills required. During our visit, some hikes were closed due to rock fall, but there is still plenty to see and do. A must see!"

     "comment": "This was our favorite stop of the entire trip. We spent the entire day in the park and probably should have spent two. The trip through Red Canyon was a great start to the morning. Once entering the park, (we started out on a crisp morning - 43 degrees and high winds, which we were not prepared for), we headed up to the bristlecone pine forest. At an elevation of 9100+ feet we could feel the altitude difference. There are trees in this part of the park that are reportedly more than 4000 years old.\nWe worked our way back down, taking in all the turnouts along the way. The views are spectacular throughout the entire park. We actually tackled the tougher trails on horseback (Peekaboo, etc.) which was a great way to see the park. Because horse trails and human trails often intersect, our trail guides were frequently redirecting people back on to the correct trails. I could see if you were not paying attention how you could get turned around on certain hikes.\nOnly regret is not seeing the park at dusk or dawn."

The hoo doos that grace the landscape and the colors of the sandstone rock are candy cotton for the eyes. Be sure to see the scene at sunrise and sunset and if you like horseback riding, you'll get a chance to look out the entire ride instead of needy to watch where you step. We stayed in the lodge in the park and it was better than average. Our visit to Bryce came on the heals of a three day visit to Zion, which is also worth seeing but Bryce Canyon was our favorite."

For the hikers, going into the canyon is a must, different views of the hoodoos, canyons. For those that don't like to hike, or can't the vistas from the view areas are still wonderful. A horseback ride into the canyon is also a great way to get a different view. Although the shuttle is great, if you have transportation, go further into the park, all the way to Rainbow Point and work your way back stopping at all the lookouts, each has a different perspective of the rock formations.\nBryce Canyon is a #1 place to visit."

Viewed from Inspiration Point on a clear day with snow still crusting the canyon rim, the vibrant orange/pink colours of the hoodoos scream at you to lean over and look deep down into the canyon floor to see where they begin. It’s as if you are looking down at New York skyscrapers from a drone camera high above. Luckily there is one small section of wall to lean into as you do this. I found myself calling out to three teenagers doing star jumps near the edge in a bid to get action shots. The path around the edge Is well defined but mostly unfenced. Locals tell you there are fifty deaths a year in canyons across the country. But for me it’s a must visit. A spectacle of rock and space and colour you cant forget."

Just when you think you'd seen the most beaufiful spot, there was another.\nWe went in mid-afternoon and most of the tour buses had left-thank goodness! Sunrise and Sunset Points especially get really busy with tour buses.\nWe drove all the way up to Rainbow Point also and then stopped at every vista coming back down. If you can, go up to the top first and then come down because you will be turning right instead of across traffic."

Lodge serves breakfast, lunch, dinner but there is also a pizza place in the park by the lodge. Clean and well maintained park. Hiking boots are a must as the trails are pebble and slippery in many steeper areas. Check out the ranger talk schedule and go to the telescope event if you're here on the right day. We just spent 1 day at Bryce and felt it was sufficient."

With limited time (about 4 -5 hours) we hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail and saw all of the major viewpoints, including Bryce Point, Sunrise Point, Sunset Point, Inspiration Point and Rainbow Point. It was a 1.5-2 hour Drive from Zion. This park is well worth a visit. Really incredible! We even saw some prairie dogs!"

     "comment": "After visiting the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon all on the same trip, we sat down one evening and asked ourselves which one we thought was the most beautiful - and we both said Bryce Canyon. Although the others are beautiful and awesome in their own ways, we found Bryce to be unique. The hiking trails, the overlooks, the change in the terrain around every corner were just so striking.\nWe visited the last week of June and it was quite crowded, but the temperatures were perfect - especially at the higher altitudes. Go early in the day to avoid some of the crowds. There are so many places to hike and enjoy views, that the people were dispersed over multiple areas and were not a hindrance. The highest point on the rim of the Canyon is approximately 9,000 feet above sea level, so take that into consideration when planning activities."

While overall I'd say Zion was the grandest and most majestic of the five, and Arches had some of my favorite hikes, Bryce is the most unique. The hoodoos are so different. The Queen's Trail was my favorite. You get down in the canyon and view the hoodoos up close and get a totally different perspective. Definitely recommend!"

Most of the trails into the Amphitheater were closed, so we hiked along the rim; this is easily accessible. As we were returning to our parked car, clouds emerged and suddenly we were in a blizzard.

We went on a motorcycle in 2015, but in our vehicle in July 2018 and I'm glad we did because when we got to the top, it was hailing! So we went back down the road a ways and the hail quit.

We recommend you think carefully about the time of day you visit, as it turns out 4 o’clock was perfect. The sun was far into the west which lit up the canyon beautifully for our photos. You can drive approximately 17 miles along the Canyon rim to a dead end then work your way back stopping at all the pullouts/view points. Apparently there are many trails that lead into the canyon for hiking that we did not have an opportunity to take advantage of."

I took my teen daughter that isn't much of a hiker on the trip, so we did not get to dig into the parks much. I know the Hoodoo hike is not to be missed, but, sadly, it'll have to wait for another day for us. The shuttle service worked very well and you can park at the shuttle station outside of the park and be just fine.\nWe went out to the end of the scenic drive to Rainbow Point and even on a nice June afternoon, parking was available, so don't miss going out there. We had a great time!"

The walk up to Inspiration Point was really beautiful. We walked miles and enjoyed every step, feeling like the air was fresh and the land was a blessing. Amazing views, great place to wander. On 6/2 we hike the mossy car and water fall. That was such a fun family hike. We went about 45 minutes down into the Queen’s Trail and the kids had no problem, bu climbing out was difficult! Hard to breathe!! But beautiful - just go slowly coming back up."

Every corner we turned we saw a different view and took yet another picture. We saw busloads of tourists looking at Bryce from the rim and indeed the view is magnificent from the rim. However, to really appreciate Bryce, you need to hike into the canyon. We hiked down Peekaboo Trail and up Queen’s Garden and I’d easily do it again. The views from the middle and bottom of the canyon are equally amazing."

The word means \"stone men\" in a First Nations language.\nThe altitude may bother you, so go slowly and drink lots of water. The upside is it's much cooler here than Zion or Moab or Vegas.\nIf you can, hike below the rim. My husband did the Queen's Garden trail and loved it. If you are like me and can't hike well, sign up for the horseback/mule ride into the canyon. That was a great value for us, and lets you see things from a different angle."

     "comment": "Bryce offers beautiful scenic views of the red rock formations called hoodoos. Unlike Zion or Capitol Reef, where you are always looking up, in Bryce you look down - from four basic vista view points - much like Canyonlands. It also requires minimal walking. This is called the largest concentration of hoodoo formations anywhere on earth. We found this park very easy to navigate, as there are four basic vista view points. We took advantage of their bus service, which we found timely and very convenient, although you can drive in this park. The bus picked us up at our Best Western hotel and made a loop through the park; you need your park pass to get on the bus. It drops you off at several spots in the park, most notable the four view points and the visitor center. Be sure to see the introductory movie in the center. You'll see unbelievable sights at Bryce!"

     "comment": "We started our three week tour of Utah and Arizona with four nights at Bryce Canyon National Park. We flew in/out of Las Vegas as it was easier to get back there from Arizona, where we were ending our trip, to return our rental car. The four hour drive to Bryce was nice and easy, getting particularly scenic once we got on U.S. 89, and especially so on Scenic Byway 12. We based at a mom-n-pops motel (Bryce Canyon Pines Motel; recommend it; see my TripAdvisor review) located right on 12 and around 5-10 minutes from the park. We liked it and would definitely stay there again, as it is very convenient to the park, yet away from the cluster of other lodging establishments, and has a wonderful onsite restaurant. The park itself, with its unique rock formations and magical hoodoos should be on everyone’s list of “must-visit” places. It has a nice intimate feel, as it is Utah’s smallest national park, and one of the smallest national parks in our entire country, yet it is full of its own otherworldly grandeur. While at Bryce, we hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail, which is below the canyon rim, and also hiked the Rim Trail, from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Both are definitely ones to consider. We were going to do the Peekaboo Loop Trail too, but since we took the three hour mule ride with Canyon Trail Rides (also reviewed on TripAdvisor; definite attraction to consider if you have the time) that is on the same trail, we decided not to hike it as well. We also drove to Rainbow Point, the park’s highest point at over 9,000 ft. You can see the Natural Bridge along the way, so it’s worth the short ride up. It was actually snowing that day, making it all the more interesting for us Floridians. The park was very organized, both from the Visitor’s Center to the shuttle bus system; all easy to understand and navigate, and made even more so by the friendly park rangers on duty. They say to make sure to start by going into the Visitor’s Center, and you should, regardless of how much advance research you may do. We feel four nights at Bryce is just enough, at least it was for us. It also gave us time to explore a bit of the surrounding area, which is as beautiful as the canyon and park. This included some window shopping in Panguitch, a nearby town; the red rocks of Red Canyon (very cool); and additional driving on Scenic Byway 12, where we continued to the suggested overlook at mile marker 70. We can see why it is recommended."

     "comment": "I have been tom Bryce several times before but usually during a shoulder season. I've never visited during the height of summer vacation season. I tried parking at the visitor center on my way in and there wasn't a space to be found. So I drove the main road all the way to the end and stopped at each vista on the way back towards the entrance. Most had parking available, however, Bryce Point, in particular, was quite challenging. On my first attempt, no parking spaces were open. There are 2 guards at the parking lot entrance and cones that prevent you from reentering the parking lot. I needed to drive a mile down the road and turn around to come back. On my second attempt, I found a spot. The guards made it clear that I couldn't even use my brakes to slow down in the lot to wait for someone to back out. I had to leave and drive a mile and return. The vista was spectacular and quite crowded. The Japanese tourists were the only ones going beyond the railings next to the crumbling cliff edge to get photos. All others were respectful of the boundaries. On my way out it was nearing dinner time and I stopped to walk through the lodge and see if I could park at the visitor center. I was able to find a spot."

We parked across from visitor center and used shuttle rest of day. We went to overlooks, walked some of rim trail, mossy cave trail (outside park), and then did peekaboo trail from Bryce point and back up queens garden to sunset point (6 miles amazing views but a little long and difficult for our family since we are not very athletic). Make sure to bring plenty of water for trails and sunscreen. We ate lunch at lodge $16 buffet per adult $9 for kids 12 and under."

     "comment": "A relatively small national park, but with very impressive rock formations to view.\nInspiration Point is an amazing wall of stone that appears to cut out and painted.\nHave not seen anything like this anywhere I’ve traveled. You can park in town and take a free shuttle bus into the National Park. You need to have your park pass to get on the shuttle. It makes about 8 stops along a route that takes you to a number of scenic points and the visitor’s center. You can get off at any stop and the next shuttle will pick you up in 10-15 minutes. Absolutely the way to travel through this park."

     "comment": "First time visit, bucket listtrip! And it did not disappoint. We are not hikers or backpackers. We elected to just drive the 18 mile scenic road and stop and everyone of the overlooks. Though you are actually looking at the same canyon, each stop gave a different perspective and was a beauty at each view. The most exhilarating was Inspiration Point which happens to be the first top. You do have a drive a bit to get to it but GO!!! It is breathtaking! The visitor center was consistently quite busy. Plenty of parking and they do offer a shuttle service though not sure how that runs. We observed them on the road and believe that once they will up, they stay with that group going up and back down, which seems to make the best sense (vs. Zion that has a continually looping shuttle service on the main road)."

We went to the queens garden and for our family, we were happy with that, because it was a good little work out! Would definitely come back again and we would recommend to others.

The ability to see the Canyon in snow one day then no snow the next is pretty lucky . We did 2 trails . The loop trail from Bryce Point and Fairyland trail , which technically is outside the park and quite a peaceful , although long hike . These parks are beautiful . Well worthy of a visit let alone hike . 👍"

     "comment": "The geology of Bryce Canyon is best characterized by hoodoos which are irregular columnar formations consisting of cylindrical spires of sandstone that are formed by the vertical erosion of sandstone cliffs.The resulting columns are capped with darker grayish erosion resistant limestone. My wife & I parked our motorhome at a designated lot near the park entrance where we boarded a convenient shuttle bus that took us to the rustic park lodge. Once in the park, hop-on-hop-off shuttle buses made it easy to travel around the park to see the various vistas. Hiking trails along the top of the canyon provide spectacular views of this enormous canyon. Bryce Canyon's vastness, depth, irregular contours, literally tens of thousand of hoodoos make it singularly beautiful and unique. The trails down into the canyon are steep and potentially very treacherous, These sloping trails descending into the bottom of the canyon are narrow, often less than 8 ft wide with no handrails so parents with toddlers and young adventuresome free spirited children will have to hold hands because their is no room for an accidental fall without rolling down steep slopes hundreds of feet below. The hikes down to the bottom will take an hour or two so each person should take a full quart of water. Even the healthiest hikers are not immune to heatstroke. Also the climb back up will be harder than the descent so factor that into the equation. But the views are spectacular and surrealistic. Bryce is unforgettable."

     "comment": "What a majestic, magical place. As we sat on the shuttle bus we were in awh of this incredible place.\nI would suggest when you first get to the park to go to the visitor center look at the events board that shows what ranger talks are happening on which days and times, what trails are closed, and the weather report. See what interest you and put together a plan to get the most out of your time at Bryce.\nFor us, we checked the visitor center, talked to a ranger about trails and ranger’s recommendations. We road the shuttle all the way to the end and then got off each stop to get an overview and photos. The bus comes by every 10-15 minutes. We chose 2 hikes: Peek-A-Boo to Queens , A Must Do! (To walk amongst the hoodos is amazing.) and Fairyland (the short version to Tower Bridge) and and a mountain bike ride: Thunder Mountain, we saw the short film at visitor center which was good, attended a presentation about the stars/galaxies and then went to the Telescope viewing which was excellent. Stars and galaxies are unbelievable abundant.\nEven if you are not fit to do a whole hike- try to go part way to see what you can, it will empower you to see the beauty a little closer than from the vistas.\nA must see in your lifetime."

     "comment": "The “hoodoos”—layers of white, pink and red sandstone sculpted into fantastical shapes by millennia of water and wind—are unbelievable. They are best seen from hiking trails that go from the rim down into the valley and back up. The altitude is about 8,000 feet at the rim. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen and wear good shoes. Hiking poles were very helpful for me (fit but age 69). The major trails are 6-8 miles long, so start in the morning. Trails into the canyon are not suitable for small children, strollers, the disabled or people with heart conditions."

The road stops at every vantage point and if you are not into hiking you can still see the best of the park from these stops. I had wanted to walk the Navajo Trail into the Canyon but unfortunately this was closed due to damage from the severe snow of the season. Repairs were underway but regrettably not completed at the time of our visit. Moving along the road to higher elevations we came across snow which was much fun and very unexpected in mid May. Coming from tropical Australia it was such a wonderful experience. This park was absolutely amazing and a standout of all the parks we visited. The visitor centre staff were extremely helpful and had a great range in the gift shop. Will definitely put this Bryce Canyon back on the itinerary if we are lucky enough to return in the future. Highly recommended"

     "comment": "Altitude is high enough that flat-landers (like us from 900' altitude Kansas City) can get out of breath. Maybe the dramatic views also had something to do with it. It was snowing off and on the week we visited, so the snow accentuated the dramatic weathering of the stone. National Park Service has done a wonderful job of blending roads and overviews into the natural surroundings. Tents, camper parking sites, hotels - are all available. Be sure to make reservations."

If you want to know more I can answer any of your questions . Hiking and photographing in Bryce Canyon is a lifetime experience ...each day with this small group of 6 opened up every vantage point you could wish for in a place of such natural beauty. We had an added bonus of arriving at Sunrise Point the next morning to have it in snow so nothing short of amazing . The rim walk is also a must but you can join at different points along the way and there is a shuttle . Could have stayed here longer ...the reds, oranges and rock formations blew my mind and add the snow the next day and it was pure bliss. Can’ t imagine anyone not being overcome by the magnificence of the area and the beauty. Saw chipmunks frolicking . Visitor centre busy but very informative.Tried other photos but files too big!"

Awe inspiring beauty at every vantage point. It did snow while we were there (mid-May). Be prepared for changeable weather. There is a free shuttle which takes you to the points of interest. The hoodoos are impressive for sure."

We made it all the way up the hill to Rainbow Point, elevation 9,100+ feet, 6 inches of fresh snow, and a howling wind. Within 30 minutes the storm had paused, and the sun was threatening to come out from behind the clouds. We got some amazing photos. As we headed back down toward the visitors center the storm took a 90 minute break, the sun came out, and the fog drifted away. What a GLORIOS sight indeed. Big beautiful orange, red, and white rock formations sprinkled with snow. The views were incredible, the trails were muddy, the air was crisp and clean. An unbelievable experience. Bryce Canyon is definitely a beautiful place, and a National Treasure. Enjoy!"

     "comment": "I remember my grandmother telling me \"oh the colors you won't believe it!\" Yeah sure grandma.... then I went there and now I get it. This place honestly changed my life. We started the day at sunrise at sunrise point, a crystal clear morning saw the sun crest over the mountains and light up the hoodoos in a magical red and pink glow. We hiked down the queens garden trail, all the way to the cross with Navajo loop which was closed and then hiked out on the peak-a-boo trail. It was hard, hiking into, through and back out of the canyon but even though we were tired i could not get enough of the pink and orange hoodoos against a deep blue sky. When you see this place in the glow of the sunlight you won't believe it's real, you have to see it in person. Honestly, we Americans are so lucky to have these beautiful parks and Bryce Canyon is surely a stunner! I did not want to leave."

The rim walk is very different from the Grand Canyon and is less travelled and quite rough underfoot in places. BUT we went on the 8 mile hike doing Tower Bridge and Fairytale Canyon. What a privilege to be able to walk through such amazing sights. The team who keep this going are expert engineers. We also met some volunteer rangers checking everyone is ok, that the path is clear etc. Wonderful service to all guests. The shuttle bus is a very good service with enthusiastic and very helpful drivers/guides."

     "comment": "Our trip was a bit unconventional for a May trip going into Memorial Day weekend. We experienced a cold front, snow, sleet, rain, hail, and white-out driving. It was fairly cold the two days we were here. When the sun came out we were able to feel what the Utah son can do for warmth so that was a nice respite. We stayed in traffic and the commute to Bryce was about 25 minutes which was not terrible and had great views of its own but it was difficult when we were driving through storms because there’s ups and downs and turns a lot. We were able to see a Clear view at Bryce Canyon from sunrise pointe later in the afternoon after some storms had cleared but we only got about 3 1/2 hours of clarity before another storm rolled in which was much heavier than the first one resulting in 6 inches of snow overnight. We were glad we bit off a lot of hiking that first day because the second day a lot of things were closed due to the storm that had happened. Because of the storm we were not able to do the scenic drive down the rest of Bryce Canyon.Honestly we did almost 4 hours of hiking the first day and saw everything from the depths of the canyon all the way to the top with sunset views and didn’t really feel like we missed anything with the scenic drive so it was fine with us."

It would appear that everything shuts down by 9 and the restaurants choice of food is not of a high quality. Many will eat at Ruby's inn where when the bill arrives they have already added 18% gratuity , but also give you the option to tip again! Considering many of the quests are foreign travellers, wonder how many get caught out on this!!\nI have been told the area is owned by one family hence the lack of variety! Compared to the options available at Zion it really is dismal and needs a major improvement!!\nMy advice is visit the beautiful canyon but stay at Zion!!\nZion has much more variety and you can enjoy the whole day/night there!\nOn our recent visit stayed at the Marriott Spring Hill suites,Springdale. lovely hotel, hence the price, however appalling breakfast, very limited food options served on paper plates and plastic utensils!!

The weather was beautiful the views were amazing. The trails were alot of fun, esp. for the boys. The only draw back was that quite a few of the trails were closed when we were there due to muddy conditions. I understand because they still had snow on the ground in spots. I will say though if you have small children that like to run around bring a rope to tie around them. Although the views are amazing, there aren't many guard rails on the trails, esp. the Sunrise to Sunset. I was on edge as were others, so just be careful. I really don't think there is any place like it. Book early if you want to stay in the park and go check out the views at night from the top. I hope to definitely go back some day."

     "comment": "I loved every minute I spent at Bryce and already want to go back! I did one hike down into the canyon - Queens Garden (few others were open yet in mid-April). It sure looks steep going down, but somehow coming back up was not as awful as I expected it to be. Very worthwhile. The rim trail and viewpoints were all very worthwhile.\nI tried to go out specifically for sunset and sunrise. In case it helps anyone else, note that the canyon aspect pushes back sunrise and pushes *forward* sunset viewing times. If sunrise, astronomically, is 7am, then the light in the canyon (coming over the edge of the canyon and down into the hoodoos) won't really get going until closer to 7:30am. Likewise, if sunset is 7pm, arriving at 6:30pm is too late - the canyon will already be out of light as the sun will have gone over the horizon of the canyon well before true sunset time. So take that into account and maybe you will have better luck than I did! (Or get some more time in bed before sunrise...)"

We went there this past March for spring break, and after a VERY long drive, we got there, and unfortunatley the park ranger (they are usually so helpful at these parks, because we go to them all of the time) DID NOT tell us that most of the park was closed due to snowfall. We paid the entrance fee, only to drive to the first stop in the park, and we couldn't go any farther. I felt like we should have received a refund. Bryce is off the beaten track, and one would like to enjoy the majority of the park when going there. I understand snow and other natural obstacles, but it would have been nice of the ranger to notify us of this situation so we could have made the decision to spend the money on the entrance fee at the time of entering. Not happy. We also, from what we did get to see, loved Zion SO MUCH MORE! Bryce is cool, and I'm glad we got to see some of the amazing hoo doos, but we recommend Zion over Bryce if you can only go to one of the parks. Personal preference I know, but that is our vote!"

The entire experience was a huge gift of time to share with her.\nThis year I was blessed with the gift of going with my 81 year old father as visiting had been on his bucket list for years.\nI had a totally different experience and it was still wonderful. We were there two days. The first day we watched the introductory movie at the visitors center, which was interesting, took the shuttle, and slowly walked the rim trail. The weather was perfect during the last week of April. While waiting for the shuttle we were informed that there is also a free three hour tour twice a day from the shuttle service. We decided to take it the next day and were so glad we did! The driver was knowledgeable and fun and we made it to every stop. There were many snow people and even a turtle that had been created at the top! The views were phenomenal and using binoculars, we were able to even spot the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and Zion! I highly recommend it, the Rainbow Tour."

Bucky asked everyone we met about it, so put your mind at ease...it’s still there!\nThe next day we hiked the Fairyland trail which takes you past Tower Bridge. There were far fewer hikers and the trail was more scenic, but it is an 8 mile loop!\nWe had a couple days of great hiking and got lots of great photos.\nIt is a National Park that should not be missed if you are in Utah."

     "comment": "Six miles SE of Panguitch is the turn off for Scenic Byway 12. This takes you to the northern entrance of Bryce Canyon National Park.\nBryce Canyon National Park is not a canyon, but a giant natural amphitheater.\nThe Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a national monument 1923, and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928.\nBryce Amphitheater, the first three miles of the park, has the most iconic and popular views of Bryce, Sunrise, Sunset, and Inspiration Points.\nWhen you enter the park at the Fee Station, you will be given a park map. This shows the locations, distances, and elevations of the viewpoints, trailheads, restrooms and whatever else you will need.\nParking is ample and free and you have a choice between the free park shuttle bus, which is NOT mandatory, or driving yourself.\nTrailheads for the Under the Rim trail, Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration Points the Navajo Loop Trail, and the Queen's Garden all begin near here. At certain times, announced ranger led talks and hikes will begin here as well. You can also participate in the Dark Ranger Night Sky programs.\nWhile some park roads are closed in the winter, the park itself is open. Camping is available with sites by reservation, and lodging is at the Bryce Canyon Lodge, also by reservation, and well ahead of the date. Bryce Canyon Lodge also features a nice restaurant."

     "comment": "If you are thinking about visiting Bryce Canyon, you’ve almost certainly looked at some of the pictures. The reality is even better. We visited in April, so there was still some snow around and there was a risk of storms. It also meant that the road to Rainbow Point was closed at Natural Bridge and that many of the trails were closed. We were glad we took advantage of the afternoon we arrived to visit a few of the sights and walk part of the Rim Trail because that night a wind and snow storm blew in. There wasn’t much snow, but the wind was very strong and very cold. Although we made a few attempts at venturing out, the weather was too much for us. The next morning was very cold with some wind, especially on the points, but we were able to get to some amazing vistas and to do some hiking on the Queen’s Garden Trail. Even losing a day to the bad weather, we were glad that we stopped in Bryce and will return. One suggestion: Stay in the park, if you can. The Bryce Canyon Lodge has walking access to the Amphitheater and the Rim Trail. Weather willing, that let’s you get just about everywhere, depending on how far you want to walk or hike. It also avoids the lines at the park entrance. They aren’t as bad as Arches and Zion but waiting in line is not the best way to start your day."

I thought we would become immune from all the rocks, but no, each park offered their individual character of rocks. The night before our visit to Bryce, we read about the Rainbow bus tour. So the next morning we, we were in line before 0800AM at the Shuttle stop at Ruby’s, to see if we can get on the 0900AM tour. Fortunately, there were seats! So we left our car at the parking lot—no charge, loaded on the bus and enjoyed a very informative tour for 3 hours! Again—no charge, except for the park entrance fee. After this tour, we boarded the another free shuttle that stops at all the park’s sites and walked on the trails. The shuttles came very frequently and waiting was never an issue. The Whodoos were spectacular!!! We were impressed—no stress to find parking and getting more information by the shuttle drivers about the park! Thank you very much for allowing us to experience a first rate park!!!"

Yes, it does not have the vast grandeur of the Grand Canyon, but it offers you a whole lot more details of truly outstanding rock formations. Even if you are just driving through, the views at Sunset Point and the Rim Trail are already well worth the trip. If you have more time (and energy) try some of the trails. The Queens Garden is a great initial hike. They classify it as an easy hike. However, it is not easy at all if you are out of shape. The trip to the garden is mostly downhill, so the return trip is were it gets hard.\nPhoto Tip: Get your selfies on the return trip. You can get down to the garden without a whole lot of rest, then spend some time at the end of the switchbacks on your way back. Excellent time for selfies, while you can your breath."

First we drove the park drive to Inspiration Point for the first view into the amphitheater (gorgeous views), then drove the parkway to the Natural Bridge (beautiful), then back to the visitor's center, making stops on the way back (one place better than the other).\nFinally we hiked down from Sunrise point to the Queens Garden (trail), between the rocks and little tunnels dug out,a s that was the only trail open that would get us between the hoodoos. It's strenuous to come back up but definitely doable for a person with average stamina. It has beautiful views as well.\nAlso don't forget to stop at the visitor's center for a nice movie about the park.\nWe had a great day in this beautiful park. Highly recommended."

The staff at the visitors center is incredibly helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Use their advice to guide you to appropriate trails. Maps and information abounds here. Take a ranger guided excursion - - there is so much to learn. Ranger Todd took us ( adults, senior citizens and children) on an amazing tour to the delight of all in attendance. He was incredibly engaging so much so that even the youngest were attentive. We all looked at the park, its geology, plants and animals with much greater appreciation after listening to Ranger Todd. He was excellent!! We took the free Rainbow Shuttle tour with Randy our driver. Randy has an amazing amount of knowledge of the park and at each stop along the way he shared his experience with us. The Rainbow Shuttle is such a bonus and it's free! This treasure belongs to all Americans; don't miss it. Wonderful in every way."

     "comment": "The first time you see Bryce Canyon it will take your breath away. If you want an easy hike go to Sunrise Point and walk to Sunset Point - it is an easy stroll with lots of benches along the way to sit and admire the views. We hiked the Queens Trail which is easy to moderate. Remember it takes twice as long to hike back up as it does down. Not ideal for young children as there are a few narrow bits and some serious drops. However, if you are reasonably fit you won’t have any trouble and it is really worth the effort. There are several more strenuous trails although some of them are closed at present due to snow and rock fall. It costs $35 per car (regardless of how many occupants) which lasts for 7 days and it is worth every penny. Don’t miss it - it makes you glad to be alive!!!!!"

Almost all of the trails were closed (only the rim trail was open inside the park, and one trail outside of the park) and the main road was only open about 2 miles.\nWhile we were disappointed that we couldn't do the hikes we had planned, we had an amazing time! We signed up for the guided snowshoe hike in the visitors center, and it essentially saved our trip! ;) It was amazing. We had so much fun, back in the quiet and still woods, snowshoe hiking to the rim. Our ranger was amazing, especially with our kids (ages 14, 13, 9, 7) questions.\nWe also walked/hiked the rim trail. It was snowy, and slippery in spots, but we were still able to enjoy it."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon was the highest (elevation) and coldest.stop on our tour of the American Southwest. It was also the only spot where it snowed and where there was much snow on the ground. Indeed, the hiking trails leading from the rim of the canyon (really an amphitheater) to the bottom were closed due to previous snowfall. Actually, the snow was a blessing. The geological rock formations (hoodoos) are otherworldly and absolutely beautiful when brushed with snow. We walked (paved paths) to most of the viewpoints along the rim of the canyon.This was our second trip to Bryce (the first was a hiking trip), and we continue to be awed by the beauty of the place."

     "comment": "We visited Bryce Canyon in early April and despite half of the park closed due to snow, the major view points, lodge and visitor center were all open. We have the annual park pass, so the entrance fee for half the park wasn't an issue for us. This also made traveling through the park very fast, compared to other national parks. And guess what? We still loved every bit of it! The views are outstanding and the walking paths are up close to a lot of rock formations. The flat paths around these view points are easy for small children to enjoy. The lodge is a little lackluster compared to other national parks, but they had a really nice gift shop selling local goods. April is still very chilly, more so than other southern Utah parks. Bundle up with layers. Don't pass up this cherished spectacle."

When we drove from Zion through the tunnel our choice was 2 hours to Bryce on the left or 2 hrs to Vegas on the right, making our way to Sedona. We turned right and explored many places, doing plenty of hikes. We decided to cut our stay short in Sedona to swing by the Grand Canyon South Rim and drive to Bryce. Wow is all I have to say!\nBryce Canyon is so unique and different with its spires etc. It blew me away! Even the drive through Red Canyon was just gorgeous! I’d love to bike there! We stopped at all the lookouts and were surprised there were so few people on a Saturday morning! We had no problem parking our rv and it was great! We had to wear jackets cause it was cool and windy but so worth it! There were hiking trails that we’ll definitely hike when we go back there! It was way more beautiful and breathtaking than Grand Canyon in my opinion. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this is definitely a beauty to see! We’ll be going back and will camp nearby for a night or two. Everybody should put Bryce Canyon on their bucket list cause it’s definitely a must see!"

In the spring time when the park is covered in snow slush and mud... a days visit to the vistas is great. Hiking is limited and be ready to slide a bit on snow and ice. The hoodoos in the snow are beautiful. ONE DAY is ENOUGH time spent here when snow is on the ground and ALL the trails are closed.\nVisit in the summer and fall if you plan to hike among the hoodoos. Best Western is a great place to stay. Breakfast is appreciated. Dinner options are really limited. The food here will not impress you. Where ever you go for dinner.... keep to the simple items on the menu. A well made sandwich and bowl of soup is preferable to a steak damaged beyond recognition."

I say trudge because the trail is thick messy snow in places and sloppy mud in others. In the morning it is all frozen. We parked at sunset point and walked toward inspiration point. You can walk to many (but not all) of the viewpoints.\nYou can also drive to a number of viewpoints. Do drive to Bryce point. There are a couple of viewpoints along the way. The trails are closed up there too but you can get to a viewpoint.\nIt is still pretty quiet at the park. I went early Monday morning (7:40) and saw 6 people. Yes, I was too late for sunrise. Get up earlier than I did! By 10am there were more people, but really not many.\nThis review will be out of date soon I know! Just go and enjoy!"

If you don't have this as a place to visit on your bucket list, add it.\nWe learned some things worth noting on your trip. If you are coming in the summer, you can stop here.\n1. Bryce can get lots of snow. The views with snow are stunning and worth the trip, but the trails below the rim are closed in winter and often well into Spring. We visited at the end of March and the trails were still going to be closed for at least another week or two.\n2. If you visit in the winter or spring, be prepared for both cold and wind. The wind on the bluffs can quickly chill you to the bone. Make sure to wear layers.\n3. The hikes you can do are still worth it in the Winter and Spring. The rim hike was a great experience, as every stop along the way gave another and different beautiful view of the hoodoos. The Mossy Cave hike was fun, and the ice formations in the cave were cool."

     "comment": "Yes, upon that first view from the shuttle (always always use the shuttles vs your car!) of the amphitheater you will be astounded. Stayed for a full 24 hrs and were able to pack in 6 hikes thanks to the connectivity between trails (and shuttle). Visit was at the end of June which aided our hiking in that we hiked all the way until 9 pm without a torch. Campsites were so close to trails and quiet during sleep hours. Visitor Center provides a respite in the late afternoon from the sun, as well as do the little shops. Bring and drink plenty of water and use a refillable bottle as it is easy with so many fill stations at convenient locations around the park. Whether you have 24 hrs or a few days, whether you do one hike or twelve, you will be thankful you saw this wonder.\nTip: Begin your day at 6am and enjoy the cooler temps and smaller crowds. It's worth it to see the colors on the rocks during sunrise and to be getting back for lunch in the shade while the crowds are just staring their day!\nTake advantage of the light and do \"night\" hikes! While 7:30pm seems late to start a hike, it is light enough and you can see a different set of colors on the hoodoos. Again, colder temps, no people, and an effective way to get your dinner digestion going."

Not much in Bryce City and hotels are pricey for what you get and not many good restaurant options. Mossey Cave was an easy short hike, it's not located in the same entrance as the main part of Bryce Canyon.Always take a moment to stop in the visitor center to talk to a ranger, they will suggest hikes and let you know of there are any closed trails."

We stayed in Tropic and Bryce Canyon was easily accessible from there and there is a portion of the park that is closer to Tropic. We visited the park in mid March so there was some snow and we couldn't visit some of the park. Notwithstanding, what we did see was sufficient and fantastic and gave us a very good taste of the beauty of the park. It was easy to walk the trails even with snow. Some spots were icy but accessible nonetheless. At this time of year, there weren't that many tourists so it was very pleasant. Notwithstanding being a month later might have given us access to more of the park. All in all it we were very pleased and happy to have visited this beautiful park."

However, despite some trail closures we made the best of it and hiked to both sunrise and sunset point as well as inspiration point and we did a very, very cool snow shoe hike put on by the Park Ranger and it was free. This made a day with lots of trail closures sooooo amazing and so worth it. This place is absolutely beautiful and we are looking forward to coming back in warmer months and hiking Navajo trail and some of the others that were closed down in the canyon. The views from the top were more than worth the trip during an unusually snowy winter. Bring your crampons and be sure to check at the Visitor Center for any Park led hikes or activities. So much fun!! Bring your crampons so you can hike even if there is snow and ice."

It was spectacular, a winter wonderland! Although all canyon trails were closed due to avalanche danger, we still got in a decent amount of hiking and sightseeing. This place is a natural wonder and so glad it’s protected. We stayed at the Best Western two minutes outside the park and ate at Pines for dinner. Bryce Canyon National Park is a must see anytime of the year but it was quite special to see it with snow."

     "comment": "Came here in December with four teenagers. In the end, we all felt this was more visually interesting than the Grand Canyon. There was some limitation on trails we could walk - it was way more cold, windy and snow covered here than it had been down in Zion earlier that week. But it is so unique and worth the drive up. We had been advised to drive to the end of the road in the park and work our way back - good advice. Many of the stops offer similar views and you can choose to start skipping them, but if you start at the front, you might quit before you get to the end and that view was great at the highest point. There weren't really many food places around and what was there wasn't open in December, but that's not why we came. Beautiful drive even if you can't do alot of walking. Just get out at the various pull offs and enjoy the view. We spent way longer here than we thought we would so allow 3-4 hours at least."

The main overlooks of Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce Point can be walked and covered at one go, each offering different views of the spectacular formations, with Bryce probably the best for the widest panoramic photos with the distant mountains as the background. We also walked down to the canyon floor from Sunset Point which is not very difficult and offers the best close ups of the colourful formations."

If you have kids, you need to watch them VERY carefully.\nThe temps were amazingly very moderate compared to the rest of the desert areas we went to visit other national parks, but you still should bring a hat and lots of water and sunscreen.\nIt was so beautiful, I can’t wait to go back!"

We took a long hike to the bottom of a canyon, so beautiful you can hardly believe such a place exists. If you only go to one National Park in your life, let it be this one. **Word of caution: because some of the trails are so close to the edge, keep hold of your children while looking out at the hoodoos. There are rails in places but not everywhere and some of the drop-offs were a little frightening."

The viewpoints are incredible, but actually hiking among the hoodoos will take your breath away. It's a completely different experience to be up close and exploring firsthand while trying to grasp the science that created these wonders. We hiked Navajo trail into the canyon which was by far my favorite. I want to go back and explore the Below the Rim Trail, this is a bit longer but looks incredible! This park is easily accessible and many of the viewpoints are paved and handicap accessible. Water is available at the visitor center. We spent about 6 hours total un the park and this was sufficient, less if you dont plan to hike. Driving all the way out to start is ideal as you are then all to pull off at the viewpoints which are all on that side of the road."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is one of the gems of the National Park system. While not as grand or expansive as the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon shines with more intimate views highlighted by unique hoodoos. The distinct color of the rocks provides a beautiful contrast to the vegetation and blue skies.\nThe park is very popular and parking lots at popular viewpoints can fill up. There is a shuttle bus you can use instead to avoid that hassle during peak times. The large visitor center is well-staffed and has a large gift shop. However, for dining, you will need to go to the lodge or drive back outside the park. Most of the best views are in the Bryce Amphitheatre area. However, don’t forget to drive south to see the rest of the park.\nThe hikes into the canyon are also beautiful. Though make sure to bring ample water and sun protection if hiking in the summer. Also keep in mind you are at a high altitude and the uphill climb back from the hikes can be strenuous."

     "comment": "The park was exceptional. But you know that, given your efforts to get to this remote and gorgeous piece of the world. Who can say anything that will match the magnificent and abundant beauty of Bryce? You would have to be a poet.\nI am reviewing the park just to provide a suggested travel plan.....we are fit and enjoy hiking, but we are not interested in hours of hiking. So for us, we took the following actions. We went to the visitor center inside the park, and got info and checked current conditions. Then we drove to Inspiration although most visitors will be there when the shuttles are running. Having gotten to Inspiration Point then we walked to Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. We took it easy and enjoyed the beautiful overlooks. Very pleasant walking a paved path with stunning hoodoo formations to gawk at--spend a couple of hours and take lots of pictures. Your friends will be wowed by the fantastic pictures.\nThe next day we went on a driving tour of Scenic Byway 12. Bryce is actually part of the Highway 12 experience. I reviewed this elsewhere in Tripadvisor. It was a unique and thrilling road trip for a day and broke up the hiking a bit.\nOn the third day in the morning we returned to Sunrise Point and hiked down into the Navajo Trail, the Queens Garden, and Wall Street which are all connected. Again the paths were well maintained and broad, so the big drop-offs weren't so scary. Parents would have to be mindful of their kids. Hiking poles are helpful. Wear heavy duty shoes....no sandals or sneakers!!! We had sandwiches and enjoyed a rest at the bottom of the canyon.\nHaving a big hike in the morning we enjoyed driving out to the end of the park without stopping to Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point. Dont miss Yovimpa its easy to overlook. Then having enjoyed these vantage points go back on your same road but stop at the turn outs. Lots to see.\nGo in October-May and you will have much less company than the the high summer season. Our November experience was fantastic with very few tourists about. The temperature also should be moderate and not the 100 degrees of July for example. Open your mind and soul to the beauty of Bryce and come away invigorated and rested."

The park staff were very friendly and helpful, the hikes were well marked, the park was very clean, and the views were awesome. Totally worth it. The peek a boo loop trail combined with the Navajo loop trail are really worth hiking. takes about 3.5 hours all in ( includes lots of stops for photos) It was difficult only because of lots of ups and downs. The second day we did the Queen's/Navajo loop trails. Took about 2 1/2 hours, again with lots of photo stops. Again, it was worthwhile. Both trails are wide enough that even our \"height issues\" members felt safe. The weather was mostly sunny but cool for both days. so a bonus !!"

     "comment": "On a long trip to visit our National Parks before they are gone, Bryce Canyon was on our list. It is a very well maintained park. (Please note that in all of our park visits in Utah, Arizona and NM, the park rangers were extremely focused on park protection and guest service. They were ALL passionate about their duty and focus and a joy to interact with). Do your research on what the park offers regarding vistas to enjoy and hikes to take. Bryce Canyon must be put on your list. We did not stay as long as we had wanted due to time constraints but hope we can get back to see more. One word of caution; this park as with all the other parks we visited, there is little to no cell service so be prepared. We would suggest strongly carrying a satellite GPS device especially if you are going on hikes. There is NO wifi anywhere at these places other than your hotel (if offered). Even in more populated areas, cell service can be spotty and at a low technical band width."

     "comment": "We have been to Bryce before but didn't spend as long there then as we did this time. It was just as fabulous as we recall it (perhaps, even more so) and the sheer beauty, scale and grandeur simply take one's breath away. However, it's not all about the 'classical' viewpoints - no; to get the very best out of Bryce one has to descend into that maze like wonderland of Hoodoos and winding tracks to really make the most of the location. We took on a number of trails during our stay - the Queens Garden Trail and Navajo Trails are 'must do's', but we also did the Peekaboo Loop trail as well and that was well worth the effort (note: do it in the directions suggested - clockwise; it's a little less energy sapping that way!). Take plenty of water - it is a dry and arid place down there - but the efforts are well worth it with some stunning views and locations and a few little hidden delights that take you by surprise - especially round Peekaboo. Sunrise and Sunset Points are, of course, well populated at their respective times but worth the effort irrespective of time of year, whilst a drive deep into the park also affords some alternative viewpoints and changes to the scenery and geology on show - Rainbow and Yovimpa Points are both well worth the drive up into the park to see something a little different and experience the Park to it's fullest. Have a visit and you won't fail to be stirred and impressed in equal measure."

It was shocking for me to see people standing on the other side of the railings or at the very edge of drop offs. It made me really nervous. We took the Navajo switchback trail down and the queens garden trail back up.\nThe trails were marked from easy to strenuous but I wish they also marked them on a scary level too.\nDress warm in November and break in your hiking boots before your visit"

The views were incredible, even taking some pre-dawn shots of the clear night skies.\nI discovered a family of elk grazing tall grass from the roadway, listened to concerts of large flocks of songbirds, and had much of the park to myself for some time. The colors of the rock formations were so much more vibrant in the warm light of daybreak, and the photos were incredible.\nI stopped at the Visitor Center and check-in before leaving so they could count my visit, even though there was no charge since I'm a Senior with a Lifetime Pass. The park is beautiful year-round and any time of the day, but at sunrise it really is something special."

Since I took over 140 photos that day, I would have to agree. Jaw dropping scenery, expansive canyons and sky reaching spires were enjoyed by all. The Visitors Centre and video were definitely worth the first stop. The printed material provided ranked all hikes by easy, moderate and advanced. People of all ages were enjoying the easy hikes. Take your time, savour the moment and give thanks that the government was smart enough to declare this a national park."

It was a full day tour and the price was very reasonable and it even included water and lunch. Our tour guide was Zach, an enthusiastic young man who looked after us very well and drove safely.\nWe did not realize that the two canyons in particular Bryce Canyon was so beautiful and Zach took us to some beautiful spots to take photographs and he also became the photographer for the group. The sceneries were out of this world and blended with autumn foliage, we were quite speechless savoring the sceneries with the plethora of colors. Zach made the difference in selecting to stop at some spots that he felt we would enjoy and we did.\nIt was a memorable trip!"

The park has a visitor center - you can also see videos there, and go with the shuttle (or you can drive your car) to the park main stops & lookout points: Rainbow Point, Sunrise Point & Sunset Point. You will be mesmerized at the “hoodoos” rock formations that create vast “amphitheaters”. Such structures are in amazing white and vibrant red & orange colors.\nDo your homework ahead of time to plan your visit, learn about the history, geology etc and the length of hikes so you can maximize your time.\nA MUST DO: go the scenic way from Bryce to Zion: this is a fantastic & unique drive, on itself one of the main attractions of the area: the rocks are of the most amazing colors : white Navajo stone, rose, violet, reds, amazing.\nCan’t wait to go back.

You might enjoy the resident deer or the Navajo Loop hike as we did. The hike has an approximate change in elevation of about 600 feet so you might have to stop occasionally to catch your breath, but it’s doable in an hour and a half. Like all hiking in Utah, bring sensible footwear, water and a hat. The scenery is stunning so you will be stopping a lot (good for brief rests) to take pictures. At the end of August we didn’t have any trouble with parking.\nBuy the annual park pass if your trip includes any other national parks such as Grand Canyon or nearby Zion. Great value at $80/ vehicle (non-transferable)."

Several scenic turn-off points and many hiking trails along the way. (Hint - drive south to the end and work your way north - views and turn-off will be easier especially during busy seasons.)\nOctober and visitors are at a minimum = love practically having the place ourselves, but weather made it hard to hike much.

After entering Bryce, stop at the visitors center and walk through the exhibits and watch the short film. After stopping, drive the entire way to the end of the entrance road and stop at every lookout pull off during your return trip. We stopped at a picnic area on our way to end of the road and had a nice lunch before the majestic viewing began. Rock formations that must be seen by all people especially Americans. Mother nature has created the most fabulous scenery of rock formations maybe in the world. Give yourself 2-4 hrs. for stops and viewing. Words cannot describe what you will see during your visit. A must see. Fabulous!"

Beautiful day, so drove the 18 miles to the farthest point and worked our way back. We were so blow away by the scale, colours to the point I actually cried !!\nBruce is so different from Zion, Capitol Reef and the Grand Canyon there is no way you can compare them , they are all stunningly different."

All of us were in agreement that Bryce Canyon was our favorite. We arrived late in the afternoon and enjoyed driving the entire Park Road around sunset and stopping at various overlooks. The next morning, we arrived at inspiration point about 30 min prior to sunrise (spectacular!!) and hiked Navajo and Peek-a-Boo Loops. I definitely recommend adding Peek-a-Boo loop; there was a different view around every turn and it was never dull. Navajo loop gets busy so I recommend starting early. We will definitely be back to this beautiful park."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is simply one of the most beautiful geological wonders you will ever see. The shades of burnt orange and the steep canyon walls will take your breath away. There are several hikes within the canyon, along with multiple observation points of varying heights you can drive to within the park. We did a father aggressive hike starting at Sunset Point, then descending the canyon to do portions of the Queens Garden, Navajo, and Peekaboo Loops. Plan your hikes ahead of time as some of these trails are the same trails they do horseback, and you will need to navigate loads of horse manure and urine which could turn you off. Be sure to end your hike in the canyon visiting “Wall Street” and navigating the steep switchbacks up through this part of the canyon.\nIf you have time and are not camping in the park, come back at night to Sunset Point to star-gaze. It’s simply amazing what you can see in the sky with no light pollution!"

I can assure you that even after reading so much in praise of it you won’t be disappointed, you would rather think that all this was just an understatement.\nA word of advice: if you are not properly prepared to hike don’t try to trek down to the bottom. The track is too full of loose pebbles & grit and one can very easily slip. Besides the climb up is not easy, I can assure you."

Don't forget to stop at every elevation! We reached the top elevation of 9115. It didn't disappoint for it's spectacular view. Take lots of pictures like I did and just edit it later for your album.

     "comment": "Even with stellar reviews Bryce is over looked and underrated. You would be surprised how often people exclude Bryce while planning trips. We did a loop that started out in Las Vegas to Zion to Bryce to Lake Powell (which included Horse shoe bend, Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon and a cruise on the lake through Antelope canyon again) to Grand Canyon and then to Sedona and back to Las Vegas. Out of all the awesome beauty and fun adventures on this trip, we were in awe with how beautiful Bryce is. As with most national parks, it's easy to drive and park at Bryce's many lots... only a short walk from majestic sights. You can be happy doing just this but there is sooooo much more. The loop trails are absolutely unreal. You have safe wide switch backs into the canyon with soaring stone walls and through tunnels cut into stone. At the bottom you have miles of trails weaving through beautiful pines. If you're an advanced hiker and prefer solitude, go further as most people hike only a portion from either side of loop trails or better yet, pick trails that aren't loops. I hate to pick a favorite place of all we visited but this is definitely highest on the list for beauty, rejuvenating the soul and overall satisfaction....we hiked a lot in 24 hours trying to absorb as much as we could and wished we allowed another day!"

It was so incredibly beautiful.\nThere was a visitor centre and they had a map showing the various walks that we could do, as it is a huge canyon. They then have a shuttle that takes you around the various locations in the park.\nWe got out and looked at the rim trail and admired the view, but then we got back on the shuttle and I think we did the Queen's garden walk, then we joined another trail and came up through the Wall St section.\nit was absolutely incredible.\nThe only issue is that there are no bathrooms on the trail. We also should have taken more water with us, as the walk was quite long and very hot.\nBryce Canyon, Antelope Canyon and Yellowstone Park were the highlights of our trip around America."

Some of the stone formations, such as the spire-shaped rocks, are similar to ones I’ve seen in the stone forests of China. The rock formations are mostly crimson in colour, with layers of different shades, likely depicting events of millions of years ago. This is a great park for hiking and getting close up views of the amazing formations. It is like being on another plant in a far-distant world. Two locations considered the best for photo ops are Sunrise Point (for sunrise photos) and Sunset Point (for sunset photos)."

     "comment": "A major feature of Bryce Canyon National Park is the fact that it isn't a canyon but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. The area was settled by Mormon pioneers and was named for Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. It was designated a National Monument in 1923 and a National Park in 1928. Remote, it attracts fewer visitors than Zion National Park and Grand Canyon National Park each year. But there are aspects about Bryce that are unique to one and all. For example, a series of amphitheaters extends more than 20 miles north to south within the park. The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is 12 miles long, three miles wide and 800 feet deep. Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at 9,105 feet, is at the end of the 18-mile scenic drive. From there, Aquarium Plateau, Bryce Amphitheater, the Henry Mountains, the Vermillion Cliffs and the White Cliffs can been seen. Archaeological surveys show people have been in the area for at least 10,000 years. But it was not until the late 18th and early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area. Mormons visited the area in the 1850s. The first major scientific expedition was led by John Wesley Powell in 1872. The park has 13 scenic viewpoints over the amphitheaters, eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day, two overnight hiking trails, more than 10 miles of marked but ungroomed skiing trails, two campgrounds and the 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge. The air is so clean that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles away in Arizona. On extremely clear days, the Black Mesa of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico can been seen 160 miles away."

One can park off Main Street and catch shuttle into park. The passes for the park can be obtained outside Ruby's or in front of RV park. The shuttles run every 10-15 mins. Pack a lunch or dine at the lodge. Shuttle service ends towards end of October . Very impressive and unforgettable experience."

Since I have a National Park Pass I did the recommended plan of parking at Ruby's Inn and rode the shuttle through the park. The shuttle can same you lots of time and traffic hassle. It goes to the major scenic spots and all in at it was an outstanding visit. Will come again when I have more time to do some trail hiking. Incredible country."

     "comment": "Have never seen anything like Bryce before and likely never will again. Watching the sun hit the canyon and subtly change the colors was breathtaking. A hike along the rim is wonderful, but to really experience the gravity and unique features of this incredible place, you must hike down into the canyon!Truly the work of God's hands. Cannot add anything more to what's already been said - JUST GO!!!\nNote: If you go in the Fall, pack for both warm and cold weather. Planned on shorts and a sunhat, but ended up in long pants, a fleece jacket, wool cap and gloves. The day before I arrived had been in the sixties, the day I left they were calling for snow the following morning. Oh, and wifi is very spotty here."

     "comment": "It had snowed the night before and the park was absolutely beautiful! The trees were covered with snow. We went into the visitor center and bought a Walkingstick. I think we started at either Inspiration zpPoint or Bryce Point. The walk was a little treacherous but there were hand rails. The views were incredible! We went to every viewpoint on the park. We were not disappointed with anyone of them. In the afternoon once it warmed up quite a bit we went back to Brycepoint and walked and the upper rim Trail. Some parts were a little muddy but it seems like a safe walk. Late in the afternoon, we hiked the mossy cave trail to the waterfall. That was gorgeous! I even liked it better than the waterfall in Zion. We were so thankful that we were there on the day we have been there because people have been there a couple days earlier and there was a snowstorm and they couldn’t see anything. I would watch the weather averages to decide when would be a good time to visit. I am from Chicago 30° there felt warmer then 50° here. The only time it felt windy and I needed a hood was on that upper rim Trail. We went to sunset view to take pics of the sunset but found out that the pics would have been better at 5 then at 6."

     "comment": "We arrived on a foggy, damp day in October. Visibility was really miserable. We decided to drive down to the far end of the road, hoping that by the time we got there, the fog would have burned off. We were surprised to find ourselves driving through a snowstorm - it was deep enough that the plows were out.\nAnyway, the sun broke through, and we had a wonderful day in the park. We did the Queen’s Garden trail, and returned on the Two Bridges side of the Navaho Loop. I’d consider this a must-do for anyone who is able. It’s an amazing, enchanting walk. The trail was crowded, but most people seemed to be having a good time.\nBryce Canyon National Park is beautiful, and unlike any other place I’ve ever seen. Highly recommended.\nI was surprised by the number of tour groups, but there were relatively few private cars, and although there is a shuttle bus, it was perfectly possible to take your own car instead (unlike in Zion, and the far reaches of Grand Canyon NP.)"

     "comment": "CAMPING: We stayed in the park Oct 9-10 at the North Campground with our truck and camper. Sunset Campground was muddier, with more puddles, more potholes. The dump stations were closed, as was the dump in front of Ruby’s in town. There are no hookups in the park. No reservations are taken, first come/first served. We arrived around 11 and had several spots to choose from. By evening all the spots were full. There are restrooms, dishwashing sinks, water pumps, and a shower at the entrance which we didn’t use.\nPARKING: We took the camper off the truck and drove to Sunrise/Sunset which is within the campground. Parking was available (it was a Tuesday) but we never did make it to the visitor center. The parking lot was full every time we drove by. The next morning we drove to the far end of the park to Rainbow Point. At 8 am we were the only ones there. The roads were snowy so I’m sure this kept people away. By 10 am the lots were filling up on the trip back towards the entrance.\nFOOD: The food in the park was either grocery store choices or the restaurant in the lodge which was pricy.\nWe thought we’d have lots of dinner choices in town but a lot of the restaurants had 2-3 stars, not a good sign, or they were pretty expensive, or had very long waits. We settled on the Cowboy Ranch House. Not fancy but decent. There was also a Subway, the only fast food place in Bryce.\nWHAT WE DID AND SAW: We hiked the Navajo Loop and visited every major viewpoint. Upper Inspiration Point was the best view by far. Early mornings and late afternoon will give you the best photo opportunities when you get some shadow off the hoodoos. The weather can change fast! We didn’t even wear coats on Tuesday. Wednesday morning we woke up to snow on the ground. The Rim Trail has a lot to see."

What I was anticipating I was going to see was nothing compared to how I felt once the full view of the canyon presented itself. It quite literally took my breath away. I was in such awe of the Canyon. My camera was constantly going. I swore I took the same pictures over and over again. We walked the rim to the observation platform and then back again. Monsoon clouds on the horizon convinced us our stay was going to be cut short. I wished we could have seen more. Bryce Canyon is more than just an hour stop.

Suggestion for a long hike--park at Bryce Point, take Peek a boo trail past the restroom on to Navajo Trail (go the right to ascend, through Wall Street to descend), then take Queen's Garden trail back up to rim and walk all the way back to Bryce Point. We are 60 and did it! About 5 hours, but going up and down you can rest on rim. Dress in layers--a lot colder on rim than down."

One change is a recent fire devastated some of the landscape but the beauty of the rocks remained untouched. Highly recommend."

Driving to each view points is easy, parking during our visit is also availabe for sure not reccomended during peak visiting season. One day is not enough to do everything. One of my favorite national parks aside from so many to choose from. Overheard a lady saying each national parks offer different beauties and landmarks and Wow factor. How i wish everyone in America can visit any of these magnificent places so that they will love more the Mother Nature and to help preserve these parks for the future generations.

Our guide was Nabor and he was very good.\nIt is easy to drive around the park too.\nAbout 40 minute drive plus stops at the lookouts.\nSunrise, sunset and Inspiration Point were our favorites.\nYou can also take the shuttle bus through the park to the main lookouts.\nPlus you can do about a one hour loop walk. This can be hard as the air is thin at this high altitude.\nA not to be missed experience."

An amazing thing to see, but even more fun to experience, hiking down and through the hoo doos and then the difficult climb back up to the rim.\nOne watch out is that Bryce is 8000+ feet ASL, so the air is really thin here (for folks visiting from lower elevations) and it may be 10-20 degrees cooler than Zion right down the road."

Than we went with this bus till the last point (Bryce point) and than have gone on foot back. We have visited Inspiration point, Sunrise & sunset points and have made a Navajo loop trail (about 40-50 Minutes).\nThe nex day we went to see the sunrise there and it was a thrilling view (was just about 40 Grad - so very very cold) and a lot of people, so you need to come earlier when you want to park there.\nI would like to see this park in winter.\nYou can use Annual Pass here (80 dollars for a year)."

     "comment": "The actual experience of seeing the Bryce Canyon amphitheatre beats any photos or guide book descriptions. We made a day trip from La Verkin and were enchanted, even though the more distant parts of the park were temporarily closed by rangers because of a managed forest fire following a lightning strike a few days earlier.\nWe gradually worked into the highlights of Sunset and Sunrise Points from more distant overlooks, which were all in themselves beautiful, until we reached the central vantage points, which were simply stunning in the colours and varieties of shapes seen. As Bryce himself said when first viewing the myriad of eroded pinnacles: 'It's a helluva place to lose a cow'!\nOne could easily spend hours just marvelling at the works of nature revealed here. Those fit enough to hike down to the floor of the amphitheatre would get a different perspective, but even just viewing from above is awe-inspiring. The nature of the rock formations together with the colours revealed by the erosion over millions of years is breath-taking. One of the highlights of our trip."

Years of weathering in the canyon has produced hoodoos. This is what they call the carvings in the canyon that can look like actual people and animals. You can look at one and see several different things at one time The nice thing is once you enter the park you can drive around and see different views of the canyon. During the month of July, temperatures are very hot and you can always expect a pop-up thunderstorm in the afternoon, so plan on your trip starting in the morning and ending mid afternoon. I highly recommend a visit to Bryce Canyon Utah for your bucket list."

We took a picnic with us. There is an area to buy food there but it's expensive.\nMy favorite area was the Natural Bridge. We also loved Inspiration Point. There is a big hill there to walk up and if you're somewhat fit try and do it. I walked up halfway to the first observation point and didn't go to the second because I didn't feel I would be fit enough at that elevation. It takes a while to get used to the higher altitude"

Bryce Canyon however, was our favorite based on uniqueness and hiking. The hoodoos are like nothing I have ever seen. My wife suggested Bryce Canyon is like walking in an aquarium without the water. The formations reassemble delicate coral on a reef more than rock outcroppings. The trail difficulty ratings at Bryce seem a little underrated to us. We are fairly healthy 60+ year olds, but the moderate trails included significant elevation changes unlike the other parks. We experienced continuous climbs over 500 feet. Definitely doable, but check with the ranger if unsure. Gotta see it!!"

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon has some of the most unusual geological formations of any of the National P:arks that we have visited. The red rock formations with vertical spires are simply awesome. The park road is about 18 miles long and is not a through road, so you have to drive to the end (if you wish) and then turn around and return on the same road. That does give you the opportunity to stop at some of the overlooks you may have missed. The park road raises to an elevation of about 9115 ft and can get quite cool as the sun sets, even on a warm day at the park entrance.\nYou can easily spend 3 to 4 hours in the park just to view most of the scenic overlooks. However, if you are limited in time, I recommend must stops at Sunset Point Overlook and Natural Bridge Overlook (a different rock formation from the rest of the park). Wear layers of clothing because the weather can change quite rapidly. We visited on a warm, sunny day in Early September and could see rain clouds in the very far distance. However, within one hour, the clouds rolled in with thunder and lightning, and disappeared again within an hour.\ni believe this is one of the most beautiful and unusual national parks and highly recommend a visit when in southwestern Utah."

That being said, we did a very long hike ( around 15 miles) around and up and down the canyon and a couple of words of advice:\nFirst - it can be exerting. Just remember - what goes down must come up. This can be helped with a planned out use of the shuttle buses. We, unfortunately, got there very early (before sunrise) and parked ar Fairyland Point parking lot - the shuttle DOES NOT go there - so if you do park there know you need to be able to hike back to it.\nWater is scarce - There was water and a store at Sunset point, but otherwise I did not find any ( there may be some - but we did not find any) - it was not especially hot and we still went through all of our camelback bladders - so be prepared with extra supplies if you plan on doing the long hikes\nFinally - with all the beauty - it is not a varied hike - more or less the same sort of views throughout. So if you want variety you may not want to do a whole day as well did and split your hike up with another location"

I caught the early morning sunrise with full moon while driving through the Dixie National Forest on the 12, just before the left turn on the 63 to Bryce Canyon. The drive is spectacular with animals all over during the early morning hours.\nI got there just before sunrise to beat the crowds. You'll find a lot of scenic hiking areas, tours, and shuttle buses during the business hours. Massive amounts of RV camp areas, and tent camp areas in the park. A lot of deer all over the place. Read up on the BLM and National Park information to know the rules and fees for camping and hiking. It's a great place to spend an hour or 2 for photos. Or to camp for a few days and take it all in."

Then begin stopping at each of the lookouts on your right hand side on the drive back. There's a picnic area half-way through on the left side of the road.\nA \"must\" stop is at Inspiration Point. IMHO it's from there that you'll enjoy the most magnificent view of the canyon.\nYou can certainly experience Bryce Canyon in a half-day with your car."

If you have children be very careful because the cliffs are very steep. Ok now from Inspiration Point head down to Sunset Point.\nSunset Point is a great place to have lunch, fill up your water bottles and use the bathroom. Ok now you will descend down to Navajo Trail towards the Two Bridges. From here you will head toward the Queens Garden Trail and Sunrise Point. In my opinion this is the best way to do it. You will be walking uphill from Queens Garden to Sunrise Point but it’s way better to do this sequence then the opposite like I did. However is reading this you’ll thank me lol. Enjoy"

Easier still just park in or opposite Ruby’s and avoid trying to find somewhere in the park at all.\nThe only disappointment was the sunset which at Sunset Point lacked something.

But, it is just as beautiful as it was the first time.\nUtah is known for its parks and monuments, and although each one is a geologic marvel, each one is also unique itself. Bryce is spectacular for its orange hoodoos. And they are easy to see. There are pull outs and parking lots to view them from, all along the main drive. We opted to just drive to each one and look, and then leave, since my wife cannot hike. If you hike, remember that if you go down, you have to come back up, and it is a whole lot easier going down. It can be misleading as you descend. (Been there, done that.) Remember to bring lots of water if you do any hiking. I noticed that they also have a pleasant looking paved bike path.\nAt the entrance to the park is a small village where just about anything you might need is available.\nCrowds at the time we went, early September, weren't overwhelming. Only at the furthest viewing spot, Rainbow Point, did parking become congested. Otherwise, it was easy to find parking at each viewing location, and traffic on the road was not a problem. It appeared that a shuttle was also available, but I am not sure how far it goes, or how often."

We spent a day and checked out Capitol Reef and Grand Staircase/Escalante.\nNote well: there is some serious elevation here. Consider seeing your primary care before you go for altitude sickness prophylaxis. Take it easy. If you are having trouble breathing or headache, consult a physician."

     "comment": "Our visit was expected to be just a few hours so we first stopped at visitor center to determine what hike would accommodate our time schedule. \\\nOutside the center are signs encouraging visitors to park across the street and take the shuttle to your destination v driving your car. After a bit of \"debate\" with my husband, he caved and took the shuttle but not without some grumbling. Good thing his wife was right again... me. He thought we could just drive to the trail head, park, and be on our way. Wrong. While riding the shuttle and stopping at each checkpoint, that's when we discovered there are very few parking spots; hence good luck on trying to find a spot without having to constantly circle back, etc. So we got off at our trailhead, hiked to another trailhead and caught the shuttle to go back to the visitor's center. This was especially nice insofar as 1) We listened to our driver, George, who gave some interesting factoids we would not have otherwise heard (he also was VERY entertaining); and 2) we got caught in a rain storm and were drenched. So boarding the bus and having someone drive us back was a relief.\nIf you get a good driver, a shuttle ride can be a great experience. Even if the driver is not as entertaining as George, you at least can reach your destination without having to try and find a parking spot. Again, kudos to the National Park Service for creating a user-friendly destination."

The hike to see them is short, and you can look down into the amphitheater full of them. As the sun changes position, so do the colors of these spires. We also stopped at the Fairyland Point and walked to look at the hoodoos. This gives visitors another great view of them. There is also a stop, which does not require hiking, to view the Natural Bridge. There are certainly other hikes, which are outlined in the material provided at the entrance, and the people at the visitor center are always helpful in planning a day in the park. This park can get pretty crowded, so parking in some areas can be challenging, but it is certainly worth a visit."

The drivers are very knowledgeable and can fill you in on a lot of things. There are two different shuttles and each take you to a different area. The Rainbow shuttle you need to make reservations, because they only go 9:00 am and 1:30 pm. This shuttle lasts 3 1/2 hours.\nThe other shuttles go every 10 minutes and you can jump on and off at different sites. I think this is the best Park I’ve Visited."

The views of the canyon from the observation areas are spectacular. There are many hiking trails, but again they don't allow dogs on them and it simply is too hot to leave then in the car. You need to lock up your car when stopping....we observed a lady who didn't do this and when she returned to her car it had been stolen. Don't leave visible valuables in your car!"

More manageable in that free shuttle buses can take you anywhere, and fewer visitors make the experience more pleasant. If you hike off the beaten path you can enjoy real serenity. Serenity Now! Spectacular and majestic scenery in every direction. Well worth the money. If I had any complaint at all it would be better way-finding signage."

Definitely hike the Navajo trail if you are able because it is great from the bottom to look up and it was my favorite trail. The fairyland trail is great also but several miles long. It was the most populated park we visited in Utah though. Bring warm clothes to layer with. This park is at elevation and cooler at times. We had not planned that and was going to tent camp and changed our plans. Bring water, food, sunscreen it is hot in the canyons hiking. Restaurants are limited in the area."

This time we drove from Capital Reef Resort to Bryce via Highway 12 This is a superb and scenic drive to get to Bryce.\nWe explored the various viewpoints in Bryce and enjoyed a short hike.\nUnlike Capitol Reef where one feels part of \"nature\", this park has many many tourists. Some mostly interested in taking selfies. Others rushing through. Some thinking driving 15 mph in a 45 mph zone is perfectly fine So the 4 star rating is because of the tourists.\nBryce scenery without the tourists is 5 star. Its amazing how many unique desert landscapes there are in this part of Utah (Capital Reef, Escalante Staircase, and of course Bryce)"

From there we did the rim trail down to sunset point. You can't take your eyes off the hoodoos, as you descend down to sunset. At sunset you have the option to get up close and personal w/ the hoodoos and take the Navajo trail. We wish we had more time, as we would have liked to descend to the base of the canyon, but ran out of time. It is very worth it!!!!"

There is something for everyone from novice to expert hikers. Go early and take the free shuttle that will drop you off at the sites. Definitely a memorable experience."

It rained while we were there so this was the only place we got to tour. Make sure you take the shuttle to avoid traffic. Plan your trip ahead of time to know where to get on and off of the shuttle as it can be a little confusing."

When we got to the Sunset / Inspirtaion point there was a lot of people. The Shuttle bus is highly recommended. There is parking also. The bathroom facility is nice. There’s a water fountain and water station for bottle refill. There’s also an area to wash your feet. We took the Navajo trail and you have an option to go right or left since it is a loop. GO RIGHT. Right is easy to go down, but will be a beast to go up. GO right."

Each point has it's own parking area and also there are numerous trails you go go on at varying difficulties. I managed to do a few of the shorter ones in flip-flops no problem, you don't need the hiking boots everyone seems to mention.\nViews are spectacular and are up there with the grand canyon etc.\nTake plenty of water, it was 38 degrees Celsius when we went!!"

As snow melts, water seeps into fractures. As it refreezes, it expands and cracks around it. The entire Bryce Canyon has been formed by this frost wedging process.\nHigh elevation, clean dry air, and lack of light pollution make Bryce Canyon one of the darkest places at earth and consequently one of the best places for star gazing."

My wife is 68 with a replaced knee, and she had no problem either. The trail runs above Bryce Canyon and connects all the scenic overlooks from Fairyland Point to Bryce Point. … Please note that it gets very steep at the end (probably the last half mile), which you do not need to do. Take your time to enjoy; take a day pack with water and sandwiches or snacks. There are plenty of scenic places to sit with your family and loved ones - and just unclutter your mind with the surrounding beauty! Enjoy\nLate April was a good time to be there, as the crowds were still on the light side and there was plenty of good parking at various points along the rim. At that time of year it's not uncommon to need a sweatshirt, sweater or light jacket."

It must be seen to be appreciated.\nA few things about the park:\n- go to the visitor center first. Theres an info desk with very helpful people to help plan what trails you wish to hike. We only did the rim trail and that was perfect!\n- wear hiking shoes and take water. The rim has areas of ups and downs but is mostly level.\n- you can not park extended time at the visitor center. Across the street there is a free parking lot. Park there. Head towards the campgrounds and you will see a clearing beyond the trees. That is the rim of the canyon! Start walking."

We parked at the visitor centre and took the free shuttle as we had heard that parking at the different stops in the park can be difficult in the summer with many visitors.\nThis worked really well as we went to Bryce Point on the shuttle, and then walked up to inspiration point and then to Sunset Point, with beautiful views of the canyon. We then went down on the Navajo loop and then onto the Queens garden trail up to the Sunrise point, the scenery is unbelievable!\nWe were staying in Springdale and did the trip to Bryce Canyon in one day, about 4 hours drive in total, with an early start in the morning, with some beautiful views on the way. Our tip would be to get there relatively early, use the shuttle, do some of the hikes to get a good view from the canyon, bring a picnic, take a lot of water, and do not forget hat, suncream and your camera!"

All in all, that was enough time to see the highlights. Went to the star-gazing with the telescopes the rangers set up at the visitor's center on certain evenings. That was pretty cool, but lots of people and the wait was pretty long to get through the lines to see the star formations. The second day we walked the rim trail from Bryce Point to Sunset Point, great hike to see the best parts of the Canyon. At Sunset Point, we hiked into the canyon on the Navajo Loop trail. That was very cool, but the hike back up is no joke, make sure to bring plenty of water. There is another shuttle that will take you all the way to the end of the park, but we felt like we saw the highlights in the time we had. Highly recommend if you are in the area."

Pretty good haul coming out at Navajo. Took us about 2 hours. It was raining off and on and storming. Drove up to natural bridge. That is a must. Drove on up and rain into sleet and ice on the road in August. Mid 40’s. Weather is something you need to check on before planning. Worth the trip!!"

     "comment": "Bryce is a wonderful national park... not very large and very accessible. The views are breathtaking and the hikes are a lot of fun. However I am writing this review to point out the National Park Service shuttle buses and what a great choice it was to utilize this free service. I am not talking about the shuttles that come every 10 minutes, I mean the 3 hour guided tour bus that leaves from Ruby's at 9am and 1:30 pm. This is the best way to see and learn about Bryce before you go in and wander around on your own. We had a wonderful local driver named April who was fabulous. She told us many great tips to use to enjoy our stay.\nYou need to reserve the tour! It's free, visit the Bryce/NPS website for info to reserve your seats no more than 7 days prior to arriving.\nKudos to Bryce and the NPS for providing this great service. Enjoy!"

Literally could not read many signs.\nRotting wooden barriers and benches that should be replaced. How can one of the most frequently visited parks in the system be allowed to fall into such bad condition!? Where’s all the entry fee money going? We came from the Grand Teton National Park and saw an enormous difference in quality of management."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is gloriously beautiful! The views are just breathtaking. Seriously, I feel like time spent there restores my soul. There are a wide variety of trails for hiking, some relatively easy and others more strenuous. Always be sure to check the weather, afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer and lightning strikes are prevalent (just check out the blackened trees along the Rim Trail.)\nIf your time is limited, hike portions of the Rim Trail, including Inspiration Point. There is a free shuttle system you can access along the trail if you tire of walking. The Rim Trail is fairly easy, though portions of it are hilly and do NOT have railing, so be careful of venturing too close to the canyon edge. Hikes into the canyon are wonderful, but make sure there's no rain in the forecast. I once had to navigate one of the trails in a downpour and it NOT something I care to repeat.\nThere are several spots along the Rim Trail where rangers offer talks about the canyon. These are well worth your time."

Backpack with Yeti bottle of water, caps with visor, hiking shoes-hers Merrill and mine Columbia, sunscreen, smartphones, trail mix individual snack bags, sunglasses and binoculars. Guide map said to go clockwise, but...holy mother of God, I wasn't expecting the surprise ending steep ending crisscrossing the end of Navajo. The good news is this loop is more shaded than Queen's. The Hoodoos are great. We went on our own. $38 to park our car right in the Visitor Center and trailhead. These trails are rock and sand and dirt. The Rim Trail at the top is fine for great camera shots. It is paved for strollers and wheelchairs. The temperature was 90-95 F around 3-6 p.m.\nJust be smart and prepare!"

Go before it’s too late and you’re saying “I\nalways wished I’d gone there.” You can hike long or short trails and a dry riverbed. Their warnings to beware of flash flooding are real. Sudden storms called monsoons can cause them in minutes. When I saw Bryce, I couldn’t help but say, “I’ve found America.”"

Be sure to take lots of water and have a full battery to take some photos of amazing rock formations. I would also suggest a hat and sunscreen if you are there in the summer months. Lots to see a day could be enough, but you would want to rank what is important to see. Two days could easily be spent seeing the beautiful areas of this park."

The way to break the hole, rock, sky rut is to dip into Bryce where the oddness of the shape of the hoodoos, the shifting white and orange gradations of colour, and the opportunity to walk amongst spires of weirdness makes you realise how lucky you are to have found yourself in such a wonderful place."

I was only there for a quick overnight visit this time...because it was peak season for the Perseid meteor shower.\nWe arrived mid afternoon, went to the bypassed the visitors center and went to the rim. We did a short hike from Sunset to Sunrise lookout points (I believe that's what they're called). I definitely suggest going sunset to sunrise instead of vise versa. Either way, you'll have about 350 ft of elevation change down and then back up again in a roughly 2.5 mile loop!\nNo matter the season, bring more water than you think you'll need, possibly a light snack, hiking poles if you have them...oh, and your camera! Take your time, but pay attention to the clock. I'd say we went at the perfect time to beat most of the heat (roughly 5:30 pm in mid-August).\nThere are other places in the park to visit if you want...more strenuous hikes, and light hikes around the rim. You can get up early or stay up later for sunrise/sunset photo opportunities. The rangers are all knowledgeable and friendly.\nDefinitely worth a multiple day stay if you can swing it. Oh...and some of the DARKEST skies in the USA! So stay up late and look at the stars if you can!"

We planned our visit with a stay in the Lodge which allowed us to view the canyon past sunset and we were right there for sunrise. It was very warm making the trails hot but tolerable. The park was clean in all the areas we visited. There was ample parking assisted in part by the shuttle that operated from outside the park and then throughout the visitor areas. I would recommend a visit in spring or late summer/fall if you stay at the lodge as there is no air conditioning and it can be very warm."

Suddenly the red hills appear after a corner and you think it cannot be better than this but you're wrong. As soon as you leave the car and reach the Canyon, e.g. at Sunset point, you've a mind blowing experience.\nThe colors and shapes of the rocks are unbeliavable. No picture gives justice and you can stop looking around noticing detail after detail.\nEven the shortest trail worth taking some heat and it's a fun park of the kids as well. Smell the scent of the trees, observe the birds that live chasing bugs or soaring over your head, be curios like the squirrels that appear and disapper like magicians"

But let's say that you can't spend more than a couple of hours at Bryce, since you have to drive like a crazy person to the airport to return your rental car. What then?\n1. Start early so there's a reasonable chance you can park inside the park. You don't have to drive from place to place inside the park, but it really speeds things up to avoid taking the shuttle in from the \"Ruby's Area\". We probably wasted 20 minutes going in a circle after parking in the main outside parking lot.\n2. Drive into the park at least as far as Sunset Point/Parking area. See if you can park there; if so, you can see a heck of a lot of the park and it's only taken you a few minutes to get there.\n3. If you're up for it (and remember, the elevation is 8,000 feet and it's frequently blistering hot), take the Navajo Trail down into the canyon. You don't have to go too far, although you should if you have the time and lots of water, since you get dramatically different perspectives by just descending a few hundred feet.\n4. Consider walking along the rim to the next parking area, then take the shuttle back to wherever you started. The rim is relatively flat, and the changing perspectives are, well, changing.\n5. Not all places on the shuttle route connect easily, so take a few minutes to understand this. You may end up going further than you have time for, and I found it a little confusing until I spent a few minutes with the diagram.\nIf you arrive at 8:30, you can have a brief but incredible encounter with the park and still leave by 10:30 or 11:00. I know that's how Americans tend to \"do\" Europe and other exotic places (Rome in Three Hours!), but it's still worth it. Best $35 you'll ever spend (or $20 if you're over 62)."

They say its not actually a 'Canyon' but it beautiful none the less. When we entered the park, drove to the end (approx 10-15 miles from entrance) and made our way back, stopping off at the various overlooks along the side of the road. Lots of photos oppertunites. Check out the Valhalla Pizzaera near the entrance (very good)."

It's a perfect trip no matter what you're looking for--you can take leisurely or strenuous hikes, or you can drive the 18-mile scenic route and stop at each of the viewpoints. The campgrounds near the Bryce Canyon Lodge are some of the nicest we've ever seen, and the hosts were fabulous. I can't wait to go back in the winter months to see some snow on the Hoodoos!"

Might be a bit much for those older or younger but you can still go part way down and I did see young kids walking down (up might be a different story). This trail leads to kind of a spiral canyon. The other one, I only did 30 min down. You can also stay on the top for the best pictures. They also have water stations which was a big bonus. I’ll certainly return."

Stayed for a couple of days. Really impressive from all angles, from above (took the helicopter ride and usually you contemplate the beauty from looking down to the canyon and valley), and from the hiking tracks that you can traverse with relatively short distances to a parking spot for your car. Spectacular views. Drones are prohibited, and there is not much else to do if your goal is not focused on enjoying nature from a very comfortable situation. There are hiking tracks that require a lot of fitness condition, so study first where you want to go. There ar some mild condition tracks for walking. You also have incredible views from parking lots along the canyon. So all kinds of people can enjoy this."

We decided to do the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail. It is also recommended on the National Park map to do it in a clockwise direction. Either way you are going to get in some fantastic views and plenty of time to do it and places to stop and rest. Doing it this way the climb out felt shorter with the steep switchbacks right at the end. It wasn't scary and I certainly didn't feel unsafe. It's an amazing park to see from start to end but we were limited to the main amphitheatre for this visit. It is also a dark sky area and we stayed back to enjoy the absolutely amazing view of the Milky Way rising above from the rim of the trails. If you are lucky enough to be their on the right night, rangers hold astronomy nights. You see so much more out here."

The views are awesome. The fee to enter is $35 (I bought the annual pass for $80 and it's paid off with all my visits.) There is a shuttle service that will take you to the different overlooks if you don't feel like driving your car. I hiked down into the amphitheater starting at the Queens Garden and then climbed back up the Navajo Trail. Most people say to go the opposite way and it's mainly because of the switchbacks that, in my case ended, this hike. They can be a little rough. But I'll say this I have a fear of heights and it kicked in a little when I first attempted to start with Navajo. So I decided to try starting with Queens Garden instead cause it seemed like a less steep entry point. That's what I did it, and it was. If you also have fear of heights start with Queens but definitely push yourself to continue. Trust me, you'll be glad you did."

All the viewpoints offer a different vista, and the colours are just spectacular. My only negative is the noise that some people - usually from coach trips - make while visiting - it felt like a theme park rather than a beautiful natural spot on occasions. I would have enjoyed it even more without the high-pitched shouting in my ears."

     "comment": "This is my second visit to Bryce Canyon. It is by far my most favorite ahead of Zion and Grand Canyon. The unique rock formations are so picturesque.\nWe arrived at 11:25am at the Visitor’s Center entrance on a July Friday after a 2.5 hr drive from St. George. Entry cost is $35 per vehicle but we used a National park pass. Inside parking was still available at the Center and across the street. We were at the park for 3.5 hours. Shuttle pickup at the Center was standing room only. (Many visitors took advantage of the huge parking lot outside the park. Don’t know how park fees are handled.) Shuttles came at 10 minute intervals. We got off at Shuttle Stop #6, Sunset Point for the most popular hike, Navajo Loop. Even though the hike is considered easy, it is not for someone with fear of heights. The trail is about 8 feet wide. One should walk slowly back up due to the high altitude. Many people were grasping for air including one in our group. (We did not circle the loop this time.) Although Bryce is about 15 degrees cooler than St. George, the temperature was still in the mid 80s. If you can briefly hike though, the stunning view looking up is worth your effort.\nAfter 1.5 hours at Sunset Point, we took the shuttle out of the park and back in before reaching Bryce Point, Shuttle Stop #3 in 50 minutes. (Faster if we had exited shuttle and walked across to catch opposite shuttle at the Visitor’s Center prior to shuttle leaving park.) At Bryce Point, we had spectacular views from lookout point."

Hiked Navajo loop/ queens garden, ( one of my top 5 hikes ever) Sunset to sunrise point. Inspiration point was beautiful at sunset. On site Lodge was beautiful and had a dining room and gift shop."

And so glad we did get to stay in the park. It made getting to Sunrise Point and Sunset Point so easy. I could see that there would be lots to do for families and many opportunities for different kinds of hiking, biking and horse back riding. Loved it!"

     "comment": "When traveling in Canada and the USA, I tend to seek out national, state & provincial parks. This summer while travelling through Utah we visited 4 of the 5 National parks in that state, spending several days at each park (except, Zion). Bryce Canyon was my favourite park. The amphitheatres filled with hoodoos were absolutely spectacular! This is heaven for anyone interested in photography. While most of my time was spent on the rim at the various lookouts, one morning, just after sunrise, we hiked to the base of Bryce amphitheatre (Navajo loop trail) for a different perspective of the hoodoos – highly recommended. If you only have time to visit one Ntl park in Utah, my recommendation is Bryce Canyon."

     "comment": "After a full day at Zion with an overnight stay, we arrived at Bryce unprepared for what we were about to see. Majestic wind and water formed Rock Cathedrals of such natural grandeur, it will take your breath away. Unlike Zion, you can drive around the rim road to see the sights. Shuttle buses are also available if you prefer. We are here for 2 days. Today we saw a lot. Breathtaking shapes formed over 1000's of years. Cant imagine what we'll see on an early start tomorrow. What you will see beggars belief. The wonder of nature.\nWe went to the visitor centre and watched a short overview film about life in the Canyon. It looked even more splendid snow covered in winter but the temperature drops to unbelievable lows. This place should be on everyone's list of places to visit even if its just for a few hours to bear witness tothis natural phenomenon."

While we were waiting in line for a shuttle in Zion we talked with several people, none of whom were going on to Bryce. When I asked why not, almost all of them said it was too far away and difficult to get to. The trip from Zion to Bryce was a beautiful drive and we did it in under 2 hrs. I want to encourage people who are considering which parks to visit to include Bryce. It is well worth the extra effort and time. It was easy and comfortable to travel from lookout to lookout in the park in our own car. We could go at a pace that suited us and we never had a problem getting a parking space. We were there the second week of June this year. If you get a chance, don’t miss it."

Bryce is not really a canyon in the traditional sense but a series of rock amphitheaters each with its own overlook. There's a scenic drive on top of the plateau and stop at each overlook. There are also numerous hiking trails around and between the canyons. We visited in in the Fall of 2016 and the Autumn colors enhanced the experience."

     "comment": "LOVED, LOVED, LOVED! Amazing! Instead of giving the same accolades as everyone else... I'll try to give some tips.\nTIP #1: If you want to park your car [limited parking] at Sunset Point - do so before 7-8 am. Otherwise, save yourself time and aggravation by using the shuttle system.\nPARKING: We got last parking spot at 7 am at Sunset point. When we finished our hike around noon, people in cars were wearily trying to find parking. Park staff keeps folks moving along. They don't let you sit and wait for cars to leave. It blocks the flow of traffic for shuttles. And because there are hiking trailheads [very popular trails] from this spot, parking does NOT open up frequently. For reference, we were parked there for 4-5 hours for our hike. FYI: Most of the people there before 7 am looked to be hikers.\nOther parking/traffic: Bryce Point [short, must see, walk to overlook] parking seems to turn over fairly quickly. All the overlooks on the scenic drive, past Bryce Point, also seem to turn over fairly quickly. Natural Bridge is the most worthy feature on the scenic drive. Fairyland overlook, near the park entrance, seems to be ignored and is worth seeing. Very few people. Nice from that aspect alone. Amazing views. Saw deer on the way.\nTIP #2: If hiking Queens Garden Trail, take a minute to walk out on the horse trail that leads to Peek-a-boo Trail. Only need to go maybe 100 yards to see the most spectacular 360 view. You feel you are in the middle of the Canyon about 2/3rds of the way up. Easy walk. Away from crowds.\nTIP #3: Wear hiking shoes/boots with lugs. Lots of loose small rock, sand and dry soil on trails. Very easy to slip or slide. Especially in the Wall Street section where crowds are distracted and not paying attention to their surroundings or footing. You might be steady and balanced, but someone else in sandals or running shoes next to you, playing with a cell phone or camera often seem to lose their footing and bump into you.\nTIP #4: Camelbak.\nHIKING: We planned a hike on the Navajo Trail which starts at Sunset Point. It goes thru the very popular and crowded Wall Street section. Worth it! We then used Queens Garden Trail to gain access back up the rim to Sunrise Point. Then walked the rim between Sunrise and Sunset. We did counter-clockwise as easier coming back out of the canyon. Again, the short walk out onto the Horse Trail was worth it!\nEnjoy!"

     "comment": "In Bryce Canyon National Park, we actually had two different experiences during our stay there. The first one was when we decided to wake up at 5.20 am, to watch the sunrise from 'sunrise point' in Bryce Canyon NP. We would definitely recommend this, as this is an unforgettable experience. The 'waking up'-part is difficult, but being there as you see the sunlight slowly reaching the rock formations of the NP absolutely makes up for the early awakening. Keep in mind that this is early in the morning, so the temperatures are only 'moderate'. Also, the spot is well-known among hikers, so make sure to be there on time if you want a nice photo/view.\nOur second experience with Bryce NP is the hike from Sunset point to Sunrise point. The nature that we saw there was simply mesmerizing. The walks between the rocky walls, the views, the rock formations and their interplay with the sun light, the path taking sharp turns deeper into the park (known as 'wallstreet')...\nAll the natural beauty found in this park cannot be described using words or photos. Therefore I would certainly recommend every hiker that is considering to visit Bryce Canyon NP to do it. The park has a lot to offer, from amazing sunrises and sunsets to (sometimes challenging) hikes. The hike that we did was not particularly hard, but the climbing part at the end (the climb towards sunrise point) was a bit challenging considering the burning sun and the lack of wind.\nAn absolute must visit for every nature -, and National Park enthusiast!"

     "comment": "Bryce National Park offers scenery that’s feminine, soft, pink, and curvaceous. You can enjoy the park from the several viewpoints above. But to really experience the park’s magic, you have to go into the canyon. You can walk. It is a steep descent on unguarded narrow switch backs. I think the best way to experience the canyon is by mule or horse rides. I took a half day ride and it is unforgettable. I took lots of photos while my steed did all the work. Another must do at Bryce is to get up early and see the sunrise in the canyon. Again, go into the canyon. You can walk. You don’t have to go too far. Watch the hoodoos as the morning light hits them. The white tips are translucent. It is a view you will never forget."

We had mild altitude sickness for the first 6-8 hours - breathlessness, dizziness, difficulty speaking and remembering. After lots of water and a good nights sleep, we felt better but it returned when we visited Rainbow Point. Luckily, we were able to get in a little hiking and our symptoms never got severe. We tackled Mossy Cave trail with no problems and Queens Garden trail with just mild difficulty. We are fairly experience hikers, but the elevation at Bryce Canyon kicked our butts. We were still able to enjoy the beauty, just needed to slow down our pace."

We stayed at the Best Western, which is only a few minutes from the park, and they have free Park bus service that picks you up and brings you back. About the park, I could spend days writing about it.\nWe live in Henderson NV, which is only a few hours drive from our home. When you get into the park, they also have free bus tours, that take you all over. They run approx 15 minutes apart, so you can stay at one location for as long as you like. There is a great visitors center that has a food area as well. There are also great hiking trails as well as places you can just sit and enjoy the views. Note, it can get very hot in the summer, so check the weather before you go. I highly recommend this park. If your into photography, get ready to take hundreds of photos."

We parked at the Shuttle Station stop, purchased our park admission and rode in. The shuttles runs very frequently and it was a very short wait. The first stop is the visitor center. We stopped to get trail advice, very good idea. Since we only had a day we did the combined Navajo Loop/Queen’s Garden trail. To make it easy on yourself, start at Navajo Loop, shortly after you start the trail, you have a left or right option. Go right, it is steep with a lot of switchbacks, but the way out is easier at the end. The trail is well marked and you end at Sunset Point. Take the path on the right for a short walk to Shuttle Stop 8. This trail allows you to see many “sides” of the canyon - hop-doos, rocks that almost look like sand, a slot canyon and huge pines. It was a gorgeous 3 mile adventure."

We were awestruck with the beauty and grandeur. Screensavers do nothing for the reality of color, depth and size of the canyon.\nWe pulled in the second parking lot and just started walking toward the rim. I remember telling my wife, “ this place is supposed to be unbelievable” Once at the edge, we clearly made the vote. This is our new fave. Walked the rim to the lookout on the other side. Easy walk and worth it.\nBring water! As newbies we did not\nOn the return trip we found the trail to the bottom. Sun was getting low and we had no more legs left.\nGood news is, more reason to return."

Here we were able to enjoy some quiet and solitude, even if only for a few minutes!\nWe avoided the shuttle which had a limited range, and drove right through the park and back. We could see a Thunderstorm approaching and rain it surely did, but thankfully on our way back.\nNeedless to say the views are extraordinary and there are so many spots to stop and try to conceive of the scale of it all. Breathtaking and if you look the other way there is wildlife too.\nQuick plug for the general store near Bryce Lodge where we bought, and then ate outside, a sandwich lunch.\nMarvellous park - very strongly recommended, do make an effort to visit."

     "comment": "Pictures simply do not put this place into perspective. I have seen many pictures of Bryce over the years and I had something different (not completely, of course) in my mind. But when I saw this place in person, it was that much more amazing to me how close these hoodoos (rock formation) are to you.\nYou can make this a short trip and take a very short distance (maybe 100 yards) from the parking lot to the rim and have an overview of the beauty, or make a full day out of it exploring the bottom.\nI agree with other reviewers that the hike down in is steep and you should be prepared to hike back the same steepness (I included a picture of the elevation loss/gain). I hiked this after running a half marathon (13.1 miles). Trekking poles may help with the elevation loss and gain, but not required. Hiking shoes are recommended, but not required. There are signs suggesting that as well. I saw people hiking in their Chacos. I saw families hiking with young children. The path is wide and well groomed.\nWe parked near Sunrise Point and did the Queens/Navajo Loop to Sunset Point (as recommended and rated most popular by the Bryce Canyon Map and Guide. Yes, there were a lot of people, but going there expecting that didn't seem to be that bad. We had to wait a few times for people to take their pictures along the path and for us to get a few shots in, but not terrible.\nIf you are a trail runner, I thought it would be a little too steep (for my taste) both down and up. We did run some of it, but the motivation was primarily due to a thunderstorm that was rolling in (we got out just before it started to pour rain)."

There are viewpoints throughout and those are great to capture pictures. The shuttle system at Bryce is simple and convenient, but it is better to drive in the park. We were passing by and just had couple of hours, which was sufficient to cover all the viewpoints but then the entrance fee is very expensive for just the drive through. Later checking online it looks this place is not fully worth if not doing the trails, so may be next time."

     "comment": "I was a bit apprehensive visiting Bryce after visiting Zion since I thought it would be a let down. Man, was I wrong! Bryce Canyon is amazing and unique! The best view is the one by the lodge. However, to truly see the NP's beauty, you must go into the amphitheater. I took the Queens/Navajo loop trail twice. At the bottom of the canyon you are in a forest. The unique colors of the Canyon and trees make it incredibly beautiful. One bit of advice - start the trail at the Queens trailhead and walk up Wall Street. Too perfect!! We stayed two nights in Bryce. We got there in the afternoon and took a hike that evening. The next day, we took an early morning hike. Went back to the hotel to swim and that evening went back and visited all the viewpoints and took the hike at the furthest viewpoint(Bristlestone or something like that). One night, we went into the park to look at stars - oh man!!! Too many."

     "comment": "Bryce is really unique and definitely worth the trip. It's at a higher elevation and therefore not as hot as Zion, which was refreshing. I felt like I really saw the whole park. I started by skipping past the crowds at the visitor's center and driving all the way to the end of the park, which is about 17 miles. The road dead-ends at a parking lot where you can see Rainbow and Yovimpa Points and do the Bristlecone Loop 1 mile hike. Once you turn around and head back, all of the viewpoints are on the ride side of the road and easy to pull in to. I stopped at all of the ones that looked interesting (most of them), such as Natural Bridge, and did a few short hikes. Bryce may not be as crowded overall as Zion, but the viewpoints nearer to the visitor's center (Sunset and Inspiration Points) are really crowded. I wanted to get down into the hoodoos, partly for the experience and partly to get away from the hordes, so I did the Peekabo Loop Trail, which was about 5 miles. It was scenic and completely doable for anyone with a modicum of fitness. Any hike you do into the canyon requires you to walk all the way down first, so as long as you're mentally prepared to come all the way back up, you should be fine. I had a little time the next morning, so I also did part of the Fairyland Loop Trail. I found that incredibly enjoyable, and it was much less crowded than the other areas."

The hoodoos were different from what we saw at other parks and were simply incredible.\nOur family of five (kids aged 15, 12 and 6) did the Navajo Loop hike, which I highly recommend! You get a nice overlook and then hike into the hoodoos. There’s a really neat section called “Wall Street” that goes through a slot canyon. There’s not much shade and quite a strenuous uphill climb on your exit, so bring water and definitely wear sturdy, non-slip shoes. It was fine for our 6-year old.\nWe also drove the rest of the scenic loop and had a picnic at the end of it. While there are lots of picnic tables there, they are not in a very interesting area. In hindsight, Sunset or Sunrise Point might have been better for that.\nDon’t miss the film in the Visitor’s Center that plays on the hour and half-hour! Also, if you visit during the summer monsoon months, you should go early...they have to close the canyon area if there’s lightening in the area, which seems to happen a lot in the afternoon.\nDon’t miss this park! You could experience it in a couple hours if you’re short on time."

The hoodoo-filled amphitheater and its unbelievable range of red/pink/yellow/white colours is a must-see. Some of the hikes must really be done to enjoy it to the maximum, it is smart to combine the Queens Garden and the Navajo trails. The climb back is not easy under the strong sun but take it easy, it shouldn't discourage you. The rim trail is also great, between e.g. Sunset point and one of the higher overviews."

Not quite as crowded as Zion but they still need to run their own shuttle service inside the park in order to deal with the traffic. You can catch the shuttle outside the park and can even buy the passes at Ruby's if you wish. The shuttle works well. You can see about half the park's main attractions using the shuttle which is nice. If you are short on time, that is a good way to do it. We actually went back inside using our car to get to some of the other areas that the shuttle didn't make it to. Fantastic place. Mother nature blessed this spot."

We went out early in the morning and felt like we had the trail to ourselves. Beautiful vistas, it is the horse trail FYI. Our teenage son went ahead of us and continued on the Bryce Point Trail and looped back and finished Peek a Boo with us. There is a rest room on the far point of Peek a Boo, this is a loop trail. If you go to Yovimpa Point, you can see the north rim of the Grand Canyon, pretty at sunset!. We did not utilize the shuttle, we are early risers and had no problem driving in. We had encountered hours long waiting for the shuttles at Zion and decided to bypass and it worked it out fine. The geography is so different it is like another planet!"

     "comment": "We have been to this park during different seasons. It always has much to offer, and great views in all seasons. I personally find it looks best in mid April when there is snow on the Hoodoos and the sky has a lot more color to it. June is different, but also enjoyable, although it is much more crowded!\nThis time we did both, drive to all the viewing pull off points, and ride the Shuttle Buses. They are great! But if you want to shoot sunrise or sunset pictures, you have to drive your own vehicle because the buses only run from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.\nIf you want to hike, you should think twice about whether you are capable of doing the 1/2 mile trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. I see it is sometimes listed as paved and \"easy\". It is not paved, and it can be dangerous since it has no guard rails along the cliff side!\nThe Visitor Center is small. Bryce Lodge is a historic old building, and there is a gift shop with a decent gift shop and restaurant there. There is also a General Store in near the north campground which sells good ice cream by the cup or cone. There is also an old vintage gas station (it closed years ago) near the campground.\nIf you want to ride a mule into the Bryce National Park, you can arrange to do that at the private company just outside the park."

It was still absolutely STUNNING covered in snow, and the best part was how quiet it was. We did part of the FairyTail Loop in the morning and saw only one other couple the whole time. After lunch we went to Sunset Point, one of the main overlooks, and while there was a crowd at the top, just 1/2 mile down it was again quieter and more peaceful. HIGHLY recommend crampons for winter hiking, we wore ours and had no problems on the trails."

It offers views from many vantage points, for those who can only make short walks on level ground, to those who want to make strenuous hikes into the Hoodoos. I went in November, 2017, and in the mornings there were virtually no tourists hiking among the Hoodoos. As the days progressed, yes, there were more tourists but it was not flooded. If you have the physical ability to do so, definitely take some of the hikes into the Hoodoos."

My wife and I did the Queens Garden/Najavo Loop, which gives you a great feel of what the park has to offer, most of the trail was shaded for us but we started around 7am and had a great time with minimal people. I would recommend if you are trying to get a good sunset picture with the sky/treeline on one side and the hoodoos on the other, go to rainbow point. We also did the Mossy cave trail and waterfall trail which is outside the main entrance of the park.\nDefinitely will be park to explore more of the park."

     "comment": "We loved our visit to Bryce National Park. There is no denying that this is a busy National Park. We had recently been to Capital Reef park and so in comparison, this park seemed crowded. But, when we arrived, we were still able to park in the parking lot at Sunset Trail our first day. Our second day, we parked near the lodge. Once parked, here are my recommendations: 1) Take the shuttle to the spots where you want to hike. The shuttle goes in a loop and picks you up within a 10 minute wait (during normal daylight hours) and takes you wherever you want to go. It is very convenient and parking does fill up. If you ever cannot find parking, there is always parking somewhere around the Bryce Lodge and Cabins. 2) We started at the Sunset to Sunrise hike on the Rim Trail. This is an easy hike and it is paved. This is accessible to anyone and you can see the entire canyon. Anyone of any ability, if they only do one hike or only have one view into the park, this is their hike. It can be only one mile total and can take as long as you would like it to. When you are done, you can go to the lodge for drinks and souvenir shopping. If you would like to do more, there are other great hikes, most of them taking you to other ends of the canyon to look into it or further into the canyon. 3) We really liked Inspiration Point which has three levels of height to its hikes and the Navajo Loop Trail. 4) If you do Navajo Loop, it is best at the start or end of the day because it gets hot and crowded, but it was one of my favorite hikes of our two week trip to seven National Parks. Really worthwhile. 5) We stayed at the Bryce Cabins in the park, which were also a highlight but need to be booked at least six months in advance. It is worthwhile just to be able to walk out of your cabin and be a few feet away from the canyon edge and the Rim Trail. 6) We sat between Sunset and Sunrise on the Rim Trail at sunrise one of our mornings, which is a real treat. Bryce is worth a visit."

We were there on the full moon and the star gazing was magnificent. The ranger talks on the geology were informative and interesting and gave us a fine introduction to the park. Every view is different and more beautiful than the one before. This park is a gem! Great for all ages."

I suggest a few hikes down into the canyon to get the full effect. I also suggest if you want a family picnic, take the scenic drive all the way to the end. At the end it sits around 9000 feet in elevation and there are many tables to enjoy lunch on. Make sure you do the entire drive and stop at the turnouts. The hiking can be as long or short as you desire. This park sits at a higher elevation than all the other Nat. Parks in Utah so the temps. here are much cooler. Make sure you enjoy sunset at one of the lookouts but you have to be there 1-2 hours prior to sunset to get the good light in the valley."

It goes out twice a day and might become fully booked when the park is busy. Our guide took us on a 3 hour tour that was extremely interesting and informative. We enjoyed the sights here as much as the Grand Canyon. Try to do all the stops using the local bus from the visitor center if you have the time."

     "comment": "We visited later in the afternoon. This helped us avoid most of the crowds. You can drive the main road or park and ride a shuttle. Maybe we weren't looking, or at the right place at the right time, but we didn't see a shuttle the whole time we were there. Something to think about.\nWe drove to the end of the road and hiked the Bristlecone Trail. The poor bristlecone pine tree that lasted for 1600 years is now dead, but the hike has so much more to offer. There was one place with a gazebo where you could rest and enjoy the views. The silence was astounding. And the views make everything worthwhile.\nThere was a rest area with toilets but no running water by the parking lot. If you find yourself in need of more modern facilities, those are provided in the visitor's center."

     "comment": "This was our second trip to Bryce Canyon National Park. It continues to offer a truly unique landscape that is dominated by the hoo-doos. Having traveled much of the world, I cannot think of another landscape anywhere that is quite as unusual as this one.\nWe were there on May 31st and it was quite cold and windy in the upper elevations. There was still snow on the ground in shaded spots. The conditions made it quite uncomfortable for prolonged gazing. Our previous visit was in September, which was far more comfortable. Given the opportunity, I wouldn't return until aa few weeks later in June.\nYou can use the free shuttle buses throughout the park, but we chose to drive our own car. We felt like it offered greater flexibility, and we had no problem finding parking at any of the view points.\nIf you are in the area, Bryce is a must see."

Try and get there 8 to 9am and do the 18 mile scenic rim tour to take pictures. You definitely must do the Navajo Loop Trail in combination with the Queen's Garden Trail. This goes counter-clockwise through the valley with the steep part first descending downward into the canyon and a gradual ascent at the end. Walking sticks are very helpful for balance and take a couple of bottles of water, trail mix and beef jerky (optional). These 2 trails will take you a casual 3 hours or more. Make sure you have lots of camera memory and possibly a backup battery (don't forget the cable). The park definitely got more crowded and the day progressed. We were done and picnicking back at the car with sandwiches and on our way back to Zion for dinner. This place was a great photo/exercise place. A MUST do!"

We moved on to Zion National Park early because we felt we saw all we wanted to see at Bryce rather quickly. There is a VERY small town at Bryce to stay at, which was part of the reason we moved on early as well."

The walls are amazing, climbing down was a ‘breeze’ but ascending is a little hard (took me 15 minutes to climb back from the bottom) could be harder for people not used to altitude hiking. Lots to see while hiking down the trail! Overall experience hiking is absolutely satisfying! I hiked down and up Bryce Canyon! Next time, I would try the Sunrise and Sunset Loop trail."

The park is very busy in the summer months. If you can, do some hiking as well as the auto accessed viewpoints.\nThe park service is limiting vehicles to 20 feet and providing a parking lot together with a frequent shuttle bus. The campground was full and we stayed in the commercial campground outside the park and took the shuttle. You might want to take the shuttle even if you drive a regular car as the parking lots at the viewpoints are often full with newcomers waiting for a spot to be vacated."

There are lots of paved trails which are pet friendly (good for us) and lots of trails that take you to see in more detail the beautiful geological structures within the park. Things to note...you will walk a lot within this park. Make sure you have plenty of water. There is a bottle fill station at the visitor center and at the lodge, but not really very many other places. Also bring comfortable clothes. The trails are awesome and you will want to check them out!"

The views are amazing, and you can drive to almost all the look out points. I suggest driving all the way to the end and then stopping at each spot on the way back. All the pull offs are on the right that way. It’s unlike all the other parks because of the hoodoos."

No RVs allowed the first 4 miles at all the scenic overlooks, so we had to park at entrance and take shuttle and it worked beautifully! Took shuttle to Bryce Point, then shuttle to Inspiration Point, at this point the driver recommended a nice .7 mile downhill hike to Sunset Point, it was amazing! And easy! We kept going to Sunrise Point, and hopped the shuttle back to the visitor center & RV parking. 2 hours round trip and worth every minute!"

     "comment": "Definitely a must on national parks list.\nVisited the park for 2 and a half days\nI think it's enough to see and get the essence of the place.\nWas camping outside the park, close by, but with a wonderful view of the Red Canyon in the Red Canyon Campground.\nA tent site is 18$ a night. Includes a picnic table and fire ring.\nToilet and Showers are close by.\nStarted the day in the amphitheater. That has left me speechless and I was eager to see more.\nSunrise/Sunset point is very hectic. Finding a parking spot, means you might need to circle a few times. Be patient. Most of the visitors don't walk the entire trail that's offered.\nFirst trail was a little over 10 miles. Started at Sunrise point, Queen's Garden, Tropic trail, PeekABoo loop (anti clockwise), Navajo and finished at Sunset point.\nIt's not an easy hike, but worth every step.\nWear long clothes - the soil is like powder and sticks to everything.\nNext day I drove to all the view points. Agua Canyon, Rainbow Point, Ponderosa Point, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point and did one Loop Trail, Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon. Got a little lost there with the Rim Trail. Make sure u have a map or direction, so u don't get lost like me 😊.\nLast day I drive to Mossy Cave, which is outside the Park. Nice trail and a nice strong waterfall.\nOn my way back, stopped at the Red Canyon for some more amazing pics.\nTake your time in the park and trails and soak the scenery.\nEnjoy!"

     "comment": "Came from Zion to Bryce and was impressed by the drive between the two and then the park itself is gorgeous!\n* There are shuttles from the visitors center, but we didn't need them as the park wasn't crowded at all (we arrived after 3 P.M. on a Sunday). Plenty of places to pull off and look around / take photos.\n* The temps were warm but were MUCH cooler at the top as well as windy, so be aware.\n* Wildlife everywhere so be careful driving through. They will walk out in front of you!\n* If you want to get out and hike, be aware that if you are afraid of heights, or have limited mobility, the drive might be better for you. There are steep drop-offs, lots of switch backs and a big difference in height from top to bottom. Still a wonderful way to see the park.\n* If you are going to more than two National Parks, get a season pass at the gate or online for $ 80 as it is $35 per car at each park. It's good for a year at any National Park and could save you money in the long run.\n* Awesome place for night / astro photography. Scout some locations during the day and get back there before dark. Set up your tripod and wait for the stars to come out. Use an app on your smartphone like Photo Pills to find the milky way or to see if the moon will be out to plan your shots. You don't even have to walk far from your car in many places!"

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon has a \"pow\" factor almost without equal as you walk to one of the scenic overlooks such as Sunrise Point. There are canyons that perhaps are deeper and larger but none combine the brilliant red coloration with so many oddly shaped formations called hoodoos. The park is fairly compact and it doesnt take alot of time to cover the major vantage points. Signs at the park entrance warned of limited parking and advised taking a shuttle bus but we pushed through with our car and had no parking problems."

Top tip would be to hike early if you can in summer as heat is relentless by mid-morning and carry plenty of water as unless you on the plateau then you are going to encounter steep gradients on your hike! Second day was spent doing a trail ride with company that operates out of the park and it was a great way to see different parts of the park that we didn't have time to hike."

We were there on a Monday and there were lots of tourists but since the park is so large, the number of people was not intrusive. Plenty of hiking opportunities, both easy and strenuous. We opted to drive ourselves through the park and stop where we wanted. There is a shuttle but I think it only has a few stops. We spent about 4 hours in the park, which was enough for us. You could easily spend 3-4 days if you're the hiking type. This park is a must see. Tip for all national parks - buy the annual pass for $80. So worth it - you zip right through the entry booths."

If you do go for it you will be rewarded with some of the most otherworldly spectacular views ever. Just when you think you saw the most beautiful thing in the canyon you turn a corner and are amazed again. I looked back on my pictures and none of them, while great, do the real view justice. Bring lots of water, pace yourself, and enjoy. Shuttle service and stops all over the park make getting around super easy."

     "comment": "We were in the area for our daughters wedding and decided to stick around for a week afterward to explore some nearby National Parks. For the first time. We stayed in Kanab and that worked as an excellent starting point for several parks. We went to Bryce after having visited Zion the day before. There are clear differences in the landscape/features of each park, as well as the experience you will have while there in relation to other visitors. Zion at times is like an amusement park in terms of lines/crowds when compared to Bryce. That doesn’t mean Bryce is sparsely visited, and as such a plan is a good idea. We are not “serious” hikers, were looking to do shorter (easier) hikes. We arrived at the park at 7:30 AM and found plenty of parking in the Sunset Point lot. This allowed us to hike the Navajo Loop trail while it was still cool. While we were, we hiking made a decision do break away from the Navajo loop and head toward Queen’s Garden and climb out via Sunrise Point. This was due to the steepness of the trail coming down from Sunset. This made for a longer hike but most of it was in the amphitheater and was easier walking. Walking in the basin of this amphitheater was amazing, a different perspective than from above.\nWe headed back to the parking lot and dove to the visitors center, From there we took the shuttle to Bryce Point and Inspiration Point. After a short lunch at our car, we drove the full length of the park to Rainbow Point, then worked our way back, stopping at the pullouts and overlooks (which are all on the right side when driving back). We were finished by 3PM.\nThis approach seemed to put us ahead of the crowds (Sunset Point lot was full later in the day).\nThe views are spectacular and the land features unique. Don’t overlook this park! It’s worth the drive to get there."

That means it is so incredibly popular, you WILL endure V E R Y L O N G L I N E S just waiting for the park's shuttle system to take you to trail heads. And by the time you get to the trail, a couple of hours will have passed and the heat will be EXTREME. There is another option! Bryce Canyon is only 70 miles away (1 hour 20 minutes). We felt as if we had entered another world as we entered Bryce. There were so few people, we thought this park must not be so great or it would be busier. We were SO WRONG! Bryce Canyon unlike ANYTHING you have ever seen, guaranteed! It is absolutely incredible 'you have to see it to experience it' natural phenomenon of thousands of 'hoodoos' rising up to the sky. Herein lies the largest collection of hoodoos IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. A hoodoo is a collection of spikey spheres of eroded rock formations. The views and the hiking are simply magical. Other-worldly! We hiked several of the interior trails, all with our 9 year old leading the way. His imagination led him to think of the term 'real life Legos!\" on the Fairy Land Trail. We arrived mid-day and were able to get in three hikes of varying distances. You will need water, sunscreen, hiking shoes (or shoes with good grippers on the soles), and a hat, preferably with an elongated back to protect from the unmerciful sun. There are long stretches on the hikes in the shade. It is QUIET as the still of night in the middle of no where in Bryce. You will be enthralled and will want to linger at every turn to capture these images in your mind, and on your camera. If you happen to have a 4th grader with you, be sure to check out \"Every Fourth Grader in a Park\" from the National Parks Service. You will be able to print out a pass that gets your fourth grader and everyone in your vehicle in for FREE. This is good for all the National Parks/monuments/lakes/etc in the Parks System.

Take some time to hike down among the rock formations. (We decided to take the Navajo Loop, and were a little disappointed to learn that Wall Street was closed due to a rock fall, so ended up going down and up the same switchbacks).\nIt's definitely a good idea to drive out to road's end, then take in each of the photo stops along the road (which are all on the right hand side as you make your way back towards the entrance to the park). Just know that Bryce will remain with you long after you leave the park."

We recommend the shuttle. The shuttle drivers were friendly and informative and seemed like they liked interacting with visitors. We marveled at the view below us at Inspiration Point and walked on the rim trail to Sunset point where we descended into the canyon via switchbacks to “Wall Street”. My wife is 67, and I am 72, but we did find the way down treacherous or taxing. Make sure we wear shoes with good ankle support. We passed some young adults with flip flops, and they had their problems when it came time to walk back up to the rim trail. We walked past vertical walls on either side of the Navajo Loop Trail before we reached the bottom of the canyon at South Hall. We paused for rest and water and were amazed to hear other visitors speaking Dutch, French, German, Chinese and Czech. I speak German well, and I spoke German almost every day during our two-week national park tour. Everyone loves our National Parks! The trail slowly ascended through another vertical canyon until we reached the dreaded switchbacks that we knew were coming. It took a long time, with many stops to replenish oxygen, before reached the rim trail, but it was worth it. What a great hike!"

Bryce has 65 miles of trails, most of which are accessible for day hikers. You'll want to see them all. And you'll want to walk them slowly, because every inch is spectacular. Mid-June advice: sunhat, sunscreen, good shoes, bug spray is not needed. Had no trouble finding parking spots arriving before 8am - you might need the shuttle if you come late morning or later. Would not recommend for children - they just won't appreciate this kind of beauty. We stayed in a rental house in Tropic; that or the Lodge are preferable to other options."

By the way, at the elevation it would be wise to have some sort of wind breaker."

     "comment": "My two brothers and I stopped here for two sunsets and two sunrises, each from a different location and each was special in its own way. First sunset was from Sunset point and we were surprised that it was not very crowded (perhaps it was still early in the season) - you can read my review under \"Sunset Point\". Next morning's sunrise was from Bryce Point - that was probably the best place to view the amphitheater from. We got there about 45 minutes before sunrise and had no problem finding spots to set up our tripods BUT remember to dress warmly - it was cold. After sunrise, we proceeded to Paria View and that offered special views of its own. For sunset we went to Inspiration Point (at the highest lookout) and I used a telephoto lens to isolate features in the amphitheater - very different from using a wide angle lens the previous day. The next morning we hiked part way down the Fairyland Trail and each of us picked a spot from which to capture images. Since we hiked part way down the trail, we were shooting across to the rocks instead of shooting down from the previous three locations. A different perspective that we enjoyed. The park is a simply amazing place and a must visit if you are in the area."

I didn’t get to ask but I noticed a huge mobile panel outside. I stopped at the scenic viewpoints on my first day. I came back a second day and did the Bristlecone Pine trail. I stopped back by the Natural Bridge site as the clouds and lighting offered a more dynamic view compared with the day before. I then drive down to the “Amphitheater” and did the Navajo/Wall Street trail starting at Sunset Point to the Queens Court to Thor’s Hammer and then on up to Sunrise Point. It was a really scenic hike and not too difficult. The most difficult part is the ascending climb at he end.\nI was there during the start of the Astronomy Festival. People with telescopes come at Night and set up telescopes and they allow people to look through them and see the stars. It was super cool! I saw Jupiter and Saturn with its rings. I also saw a few other galaxies and a star nebulous."

We didn't, but if you want a faster, safer hike and also want to hike more slots, then you might want to consider wearing them. Each slot varies in difficulty.\nI would definitely go back. We went to a few other canyons in the area and thought Bryce was the best."

You can also take the Bryce shuttle for free with pick up locations outside the park. You can hop on and off.\nIf you are planning to go and stay inside the park I recommend you reserve on line as soon as possible. The Cabin was my favorite though the motel room is also fine. The rooms do not have air conditioning but it gets very cool at nite so leave the windows open. There was a fire place in cabin but we didn’t use it. Coffee pot with coffee and cream and sugar packs were included. Our 2 double bed cabin was very clean and rustic. A nice closet had a sink and vanity with hair dryer. Cabin had a nice full bathroom. Nice high ceiling fan. Also a little porch to sit and relax. There are cabins close to the rim, maybe 100 yards at the most. Which come in very handy. We spent 2 days. Best advice is to get up early and get started before the crowds. I was up for a sunrise hike by myself. Very safe lots of folks around. We drove our car out to the furthest - Rainbow point. Ate our breakfast in a little shelter situated at the rim as it was windy and a little chilly in early am. We. Walked bristlecone trail. Visited Yovinpa Point and did part of Riggs spring Loop Trail. Spectacular views. We stopped at all the scenic overlooks on the way back. A few have short hikes you can take (they connect to under the rim trail farther down). This was a good plan for first day to get acclimated to the park. Early Next day we did the Navajo ( Wall Street is a must) and Queens trail. Ate our breakfast during a rest stop. Both moderate trails. Make sure to take water and snacks as a leisurely pace can take several hours. Trails are marked and in good shape. We wore sturdy sneakers and did fine. Both trails can be very dusty so a bandanna can come in handy.\nWe ate in the lodge both nights early. They Do not take reservations.\nFood was very good. A tad on high side. There is a casual pizza place near the lodge as well and other places outside the park. We brought snacks, water etc with us into the park so did not visit the general store. It was hot during the day and cold at nite and early am so dress in layers and bring sunscreen and a hat. The sun is very intense.\nHope this is helpful and you enjoy your visit. We sure did!"

Be aware though even in early May these pull ins were very busy so you may not always be able to park first time to admire the views.\nWe have seen some truly amazing sites in Canada and Alaska, and Bryce Canyon is up there with them.

     "comment": "This is what I did for a complete afternoon. I decided to shuttle in from Ruby's at about Noon. So I took the shuttle to Bryce Point. You can drive to the points but I wanted to walk and go along the rim from Bryce Point to Sunset Point and then back to the Visitor Center, where I caught the shuttle back to Ruby's just before 5 PM. If you do this, be aware that much of the trail is on gravel or dirt and there is a bit of uphill walking, but not much. The views on the walk are amazing and varied. By walking you can stop anywhere on the rim to see amazing vistas and take photos and videos. This walk will pass the other rim views accessible by both the shuttle and auto. You can even do more than this by taking the rim trail farther to Fairyland Point. But I hadn't the time. The Fairyland loop is another option. It will take you down from the rim into the canyons and then up again. You can begin the access here either at Sunrise Point or Fairyland which is outside the park entry and not accessed via the shuttle. Lots of people do one of the loop canyon trails down and up from Sunset Point. You can also drive out farther to other viewpoints, such as Rainbow. The shuttle does not continue this way. But sometimes with your own vehicle, you can meet a ranger at Rainbow Point for a day hike. Refreshments on this walk are either at the Visitor Center or the Lodge area by Sunset Point. So don't walk without drink and food to chomp on."

Definitely walk the Navajo/Queens Garden trail if you are at all able to do so, and visit the various observation points.\nSome of the pluses of Bryce: it's not as hot as most of the other parks, due to its higher elevation. It's also not as crowded as Zion; while they do offer a nice bus service, parking was doable within the park (this was a summer weekday).\nThe only drawback on this trip was missing out on the sunset views, as a thunderstorm rolled through in the afternoon and spoiled our plans."

I would advise getting an annual pass if going to multiple US national parks (cost US80). The line up wasn’t to bad.\nThere was buses available to visit the canyon, but we used our car and found parking available. Albeit I don’t think we were at the park anywhere near peak!\nThe natural beauty of Bryce is just amazing. We walked the Navajo Loop which was a demanding hike but worth it for the views.\nProbably not a hike you should do if your don’t have a medium level of fitness.\nHowever you still get amazing views from the top of the canyon.\nWe probably should have spent a little more time in this park, but we still had a two hour drive to St George. So after hiking for 120 minutes we made our way out of the park."

The hiking is absolutely breathtaking here; the Hoodoos are like something you have never seen before and every corner is different with a new surprise. There are biking trails all over Bryce & we actually rode our bikes from an RV Park outside of the National Park straight to the trailheads. If you can get a reservation...their Canyon Trail Rides are amazing! We have rode horses in many different places and this was, by far, the best company we have been with!\nBryce Canyon National Park is listed as one of the darkest places on earth, so wish that you don't get a full moon so that you can take full advantage. They actually have a specialized Ranger Force that are experts in everything celestial. Bryce Canyon has Night Sky Talks, Astronomy Programs and Geology Talks so don't forget to check the Visitor's Center while planning your visit.\nThere is plenty of water and restrooms near all of the trailheads, we never had any problem with that, just remember your water bottle.\nAges 8, 10, 13, 16\nJune Weather - Days 70's Nights 40's"

Drive to the end, Rainbow Point, and then stop at the view points along the way back so the pull offs will be on your right. Safer than trying to cut across traffic.\nThis canyon is far less busy as the others. We visiting early June and there was no traffic to speak off. The odd bus load of tourists would show up at a viewpoint and that could be a bit frustrating. There are many hiking paths all along the canyon. The hoodoos are beautiful and the amount of them is amazing."

It is one of our most amazing national parks. The rock formations are out of this world whether you are viewing them from rim trails or hike through them on one of the many trails. If you can only hike one, make it the Queen's Garden trail.\nThere is convenient shuttle service throughout the park but you can also drive your own vehicle easily. However, parking is limited at the popular sites. Take the shuttle.\nWe camped and had no problem getting a first come, first serve site. However, you should arrive earlier in the day since campgrounds fill quickly. The sites in the campground are beautifully laid out. There is also a lodge and cabins available. The lodge has a restaurant but there is also a store in the park which offers all the needed items for camping, gifts as well as a cafe and hot showers.\nPlan a visit today, you won't be disappointed...."

Every direction you turn is a photo moment.\nEven if your not up for a walk there are several stunning viewpoints along the road. We actually drove from visitor center first day to rainbow point checking out the area. Then over the next week we did out up close and personal hikes.\nTake lots of water as its dry and dusty if you plan on doing some of the longer hikes.\nVisitor center is nice and recommend the 20 min or so video they play."

I would highly recommend taking a route that includes the \"Hwy 12\" scenic drive towards Bryce Canyon. You will drive through arches with little stops along the way. If you have ever been on the Cars ride at Disneyland the views are like that but 1000x better.\nAt Bryce Canyon Entrance grab a map this will show you all the stops on the way. Some have hiking trails other are just vista points. At the Bryce Canyon Lodge turnout there are picnic tables and nice bathrooms.\nWe brought in our own food and had a nice picnic with views of the Sunset and Sunrise points.\nThere are so many stops/ pull outs along the way. Some are only vista points and others do include hiking trails."

It was just as spectacular and awe-inspiring on our second trip as it was on the first. Go any time of the day, but sunset and sunrise are both very special. When you start up the road, go directly to the top, do NOT stop at any of the turnouts. The turnouts are on the left so go up and then stop at each on the way down. This way you won't have to cross over traffic to get back on the road. You might want to carry some food with you as well. We have done this on both visits are were glad we did. We were in the park about 4 hours. We stopped at all the turnouts and took our time."

There are many viewing areas along the eighteen mile drive along the top of the cliffs, each one more mind-boggling than the next. You can drive your own car or use the convenient shuttle buses to go from viewpoint to viewpoint.The signage throughout the park is well-marked. All of the park employees I encountered were friendly and very informative. The lines to enter the park were not bad although midday they were getting longer. Unlike nearby Zion, there is ample parking available. The many trails down over the cliffs are relatively easy hikes although in the high elevation, the hike back up can be strenuous, depending on your fitness level. I very highly recommend Bryce Canyon. Like Ebenezer Bryce said \"It's one hell of a place to lose a cow\"."

The most popular trail from Sunrise to Inspiration is accessible and even allows dogs. You can go into the canyons from there, but you don't have to - you'll get a great view from almost any point. If you're like me and can't handle steep downhills, do the rest of the Rim Trail - the less traveled part. Park (or shuttle) to the other parts and get new views that are amazing. There's no bad hikes here. And don't miss the top - it's a bit taxing at 9300 ft, but worth the drive. Take a picnic or buy one at the camp store - plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view. And bring your camera."

However a hike down among the “hoodoos” is well worth the steep trail. Only problem we had was finding good food. We tried #1 & 2 from Trip advisor and were not impressed. Best meal we had there was from a small pizza place behind the lodge."

More color, more beauty, more unusual. Take note that the elevation in the park is high so it was very cold up there - we actually saw a wet slushy snow falling and it's the end of May."

We drove the 16 miles to Yovimpa Point and hiked the Bristlecone Loop Trail. Then we made our way back and stopped at all the different points for more wonderful views. The weather was rainy off and on so we couldn't hike as many trails. However, did manage a hike at Inspiration Point and Sunrise Point down the Amphitheater to see several bridges and Queen Victoria.\nThe rain made for a few beautiful rainbows. Coming from Hawaii where rainbows are a common occurrence, these were some of the most beautiful we've seen.\nWe loved this park and would visit again if we get the chance."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon National Park surprised me, because I was thinking that something most impressive and beautiful like Grand Canyon it can't be.\nThis park is situated in the South of Utah, and his name came from the man who built his house near the area - Ebenezer Bryce.\nActually, what I saw in this park isn't some canyons, as I have learned at the school.\nHere I saw many amphitheaters with the weirdest relief shape, you can imagine.\nAlso, the color of the rocks are amazing - white, red, orange, so on.\nWith the tourist bus, I climbed from an observation point to another, from 8000 feet (2400 meters) to almost 9000 feet (2700 meters).\nThe spectacles from every observation point are fantastic - maybe Bryce Point to overcome the other points - Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration. That's because the Bryce Point being the highest observation point (8800 feet - 2640 meters) dominate the all ensemble of the amphitheaters.\nSometime, I believed to see some castles, towers, soldiers, hammers, so on, in all color tones.\nThe feeling with what I stared at this kind of miracles was impressive."

As we did not have our own transportation, we had Larry from Kanab Tour Company as our guide driver. He brought us to various view points and helped with our pictures. Weather in Bryce can be unpredictable because of the elevation, we had hail, snow and rain in a matter of 15mins. Obviously, one day was not enough, we hope to be back in future to do other trails. Our lunch in Ruby’s Inn was included in the tour and food there was as good as the scenery."

We road to the Bryce overlook, which was the shuttle's last stop, and walked over the rim to the peekaboo trail. It took us 3.5 hours to walk it. Fairly strenuous but breathtaking. If you start from the last stop like we did when you get to the peekaboo loop stay left for the best views then catch the Navajo trail back up to the rim. Take it slow, bring a walking stick, make sure your shoes fit. The down and uphill can crunch your toes into the front of your shoes if they don't and you sure don't want blisters... Take water. Once committed it is all uphill to return or continue."

     "comment": "We spent 24 hours at Bryce Canyon. Upon arrival, we drove the scenic drive out to Inspiration Point. Stunning views. We also stopped at the Natural Bridge scenic pulloff. It was worth the stop. Beautiful. From there, we headed to the main lodge to check in. We opted to stay the night to see the night skies and the sunrise over the amphitheater. After check in, we hiked the Queens Garden and Navajo loop trails. A very fun hike, but not for the weak. The hike down and back up is strenuous, but we enjoyed all the fun twists and turns within the amphitheather. Viewing the hoodoos, walking through the arches, it was nature's art, and it was fantastic! We stayed in the sunrise building just outside the main lodge. We were within 100 yards of the amphitheater so we went out late night to see the stars and again at sunrise to see the sun come up over the amphitheater. Many other reviews said the sunset and sunrise was a critical part of experiencing Bryce, but I am not in that category. It was fine, but if I had to do again, I could have spent 6-8 hours at Bryce and moved on. I didn't feel I saw anything different at sunset or sunrise that I didn't already see during the day. I would say get there early in the day and move to your next destination by late afternoon. If you do decide to stay, I recommend Bryce Canyon Lodge for food. We had dinner and breakfast there. Both were fantastic!"

     "comment": "We stayed at Bryce Canyon Lodge during our visit and it was great (separate review for the Lodge).\nWe parked at Ruby's Inn, bought our passes and took the free shuttle into the park. We decided to do the moderate Navajo trail and added Peekaboo at the suggestion of a fellow traveller. The views were spectacular. We passed through wind tunnels and got unfiltered views of the hoodoos. This trek is not for the weak-hearted. It is strenuous and has sudden elevation changes. Carry plenty of water and snacks and take frequent breaks. Dress in layers as it gets warm and cold and the weather changes are as confusing as the elevation changes. We finished the hike in under 2 hours and slept for 4 hours after that. Yes, it was that strenuous.\nOk, I am sure everyone is curious to know what the meh was - the shuttle driver asked everyone where they were from. There was a couple from CA. He said to them- hey people around here dislike you guys, so if someone stops you, just say you are from elsewhere. He repeated it again in case they had not heard him the first time. As they got off he told them not to feed the bears. Even the guy from France who spoke in monosyllables got love :-((\nSorry shuttle driver - you had something nice to say about everyone except CA. Not nice .. Be kind to all the states. If you nothing nice to say, at least do not be rude."

We pretty much did everything you could do by car, in one packed day. This included a couple of short walks. So if you don't want to hike much, I would recommend staying 2 nights & using your full day to do the park by car as we did. I want to come back & do some longer hikes, would obviously require staying 3+ nights.\n(Also, this was a family trip in which all of us \"kids\" are middle-aged, don't know why tripadvisor does not provide a plain \"family\" button below)"

This scenic drive in this park is \"above\" the canyon - and the views are unbelievable. Drive to the end of the 18 mi scenic drive to Rainbow Point and then work your way back north on the road as all of the pullouts are on the east. Stop at every one - you will not be disappointed. The hoodoos are interesting. Binoculars or a long lens camera are helpful. This is also a great place for some star gazing at night - Paria View is pretty unobstructed.You can walk along the rim trail a little or alot - definately consider from Sunrise to Sunset or the Queens trail. For the avid hiker - this place is great."

From there we used our $80 National Parks annual pass to board a shuttle bus free of charge and it took us into the park. We got dropped off at the visitor centre, watched a 20 minute film about how the park was formed and then headed to the 4 key points of the park as highlighted by their website. These points are Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point. We took a shuttle to Bryce Point first, where we walked a part of the upper rim trail before heading back to the shuttle. We then headed for inspiration point and walked from there back to the Visitor Centre (stopping off at the General Store at Sunrise Point for food on the way). This whole trek took about 4 hours and it wasn’t strenuous at all. There are more strenuous hikes available for hardened walkers but that’s not us!"

If you are short on time, hike the Navajo Loop Trail for an up close look at the Canyon's out of this world hoodoos. Every step you take presents another photo op. If you are not up for a strenuous hike, walk along the Rim Trail, take in Inspiration Point and drive the Park Road stopping at all the amazing viewpoints. If you're staying in the area, be sure to step outside at night and see more stars than you likely ever have.\n*NOTE: If you are visiting more than 2 National Parks, buy the American the Beautiful National Park Pass which allows unlimited admissions at all U.S. National Parks for one year for only $80.00, Passing back and forth through Zion in order to get to Bryce costs $25.00 each way.

     "comment": "My husband and I look forward to eating at Bryce Canyon Lodge Dining Room each time we visit Bryce. This latest visit was disappointing. The Dining Room still has a very nice atmosphere, but the food was absolutely sub-par compared to prior visits. Our bread was cold and tasted stale. The salad was not fresh. The main course of salmon was served along with bland mixed vegetables and rice, colorless, no garnish. It was not attractively served. We take responsibility for the dry, overcooked salmon, as we like our fish cooked through, not translucent. Our waiter was rushed, he misunderstood our wine request and he seemed upset that we asked him to bring us the correct wine. Last year we had a waiter who was obviously very experienced and made the dining experience much more pleasant for us. Also, (and certainly not the fault of the hotel), there was an extremely loud guest holding forth at an adjoining table, who probably ruined several other guests' dinner. A solution to this problem could be requiring resort casual dress, no t-shirts and flip flops. People who dress better, behave better. This would be more apropos for a classic old lodge dining experience. Frankly, the entire ambiance of the hotel has changed. No cozy fire in the fireplace, even though it was a chilly evening, the lights were way too bright in the lobby, and outside terraces very, very dark. Softer lighting inside and lamps on the outside terraces would improve the charm of the place considerably. We stayed here several years ago, but switched to a different hotel in the last couple of years, so cannot report on the rooms. Also, want to mention that when you walk into the lobby, the desk clerks do not look up to greet the guests. Very cool welcome indeed for guests who want to spend money in your establishment!"

The wife and I were at first overwhelmed with the view and then we quickly made a game plan.....go to the very end of the scenic drive and work our way back to the park entrance and try not to miss anything ! The views are spectacular and awesome. Hoodoos are magical and the light changes every minute and with every passing cloud the scene is different. The Visitor Center is very nice and the NP folks are very friendly and helpful. The pull offs, view points and trail heads are well marked. The day we were there was mid week and not overly crowded.

And it is steep, with high altitude, and is tough for us normal folks!!\nTake several bottles of water, several snacks, hiking poles might be helpful if you have some, but not needed. There are plenty of places to stop, lean, sit....or flat out lay down if needed. Haha.\nBut Holy Hoodoo’s, this place is an amazing display of nature at its best!!\nI think these formations rank 2nd only my favorite Sequoia Trees in Yosemite!!\nI would be careful with young children, if they are not good at staying close, and listening....there are monster sized cliffs and drop offs, and loose gravel that could be slippery if they are running or roughhousing. And the result would not be good. Think worst case scenario here, if they were to fall over an edge!!"

     "comment": "Hubby and I visited this beautiful national park in early April. The weather was cool, with snow and wind one day. Hiking was comfortable, however, with layering. The sights and hoodoos are amazing. To truly appreciate the beauty, one must hike down into the canyon, although there is a well maintained road running the length of the canyon. The trails are wide and well groomed. There are a variety of trail lengths and difficulty. All are well documented in the park newspaper. Be sure to carry water as this is a desert region. Maps of the trails are available at the Welcome Center. You can also speak with a ranger about various hikes within the park and at nearby state parks and national forest facilities. There are many educational displays in the center and a well stocked store. Ranger talks are scheduled daily, more so as the weather warms up. The rangers are friendly and very knowledgeable. Free bus service to town begins April 13. We stayed in the park at the lodge. It was pricy, but comfortable and well worth the cost to be within walking distance of trails and the restaurant. It was also more relaxed and less touristy than Ruby’s, although Ruby’s has an amazing store. (Were warned by multiple people to avoid the restaurant at Ruby’s) At in the lodge restaurant, service was quick and friendly and the food was delicious. Also ate at Bryce Canyon Pines, outside of the park. The Pines lived up to the praises we heard from everyone recommending an off site restaurant. Pie at the pines is amazing! Spring and fall are much less crowded at Bryce than summer. Also found the park less crowded than Zion National Park. We spent three days hiking within the park, another visiting nearby trails outside of the main entrance. Weather did not cooperate for a sunset view of the canyon. We had heard how spectacular sunsets were from numerous people. A wonderful experience."

     "comment": "We were in Bryce in late April - it was pretty cold and windy (I wore winter gloves one morning and was glad I packed all the winter stuff I didn't need in Moab.) We just happened to see a tour the afternoon we arrived and were driving around the park on our own. We found out it is a completely free bus tour that is part of the Park - it runs once in the morning and once in the afternoon for about 40 people - first come, first served. You must call to make a reservation - information in the Bryce NP website. It does not go through all the park sights but hits many of the major ones and lasts about 3 hours depending on where you are picked up. As an adjunct to doing parts of the park on your own - I highly recommend it for the information the guide provides and the opportunity to let someone else do the driving so you can just enjoy the views. The tour stops at about 6 spots for photos and some walking along with information about the park from the guide/driver. April was our guide, who is a local and a fountain of knowledge about the park (and tells a few really awful jokes.)"

The hoodoos look like Hindu Temples. The colors were different range of white, pink and red.\nThe tips\n1. Start early so that you can find parking.\n2. If the parking at sunrise and sunset points are close, park at the SUNSET LODGE. the lodge has extra parking and is between sunrise and sunset points.\n3. Enjoy the hike on the rim at different Scenic points around the Canyon as it look different from each of the points.\n4. We did not hike all the way down but Go down from Sunset and come back up from sunrise that is better.\n5. The hike is moderate not easy.\n6. If you planning to go to multiple National parks- Take an annual membership, as it is cheaper than paying $30 for each park."

     "comment": "The rock formations — “hoodoos” — are really something to behold. You begin to wonder whether the architects of the fabulous castles and cathedrals in Europe somehow drew their inspiration from these natural wonders. The color is constantly changing with the movement of the sun. The hike down into the canyon is moderate and only takes about 1.5 hours; a bit strenuous on the way up. The park has a lot of nice viewing spots you can reach by car or shuttle; it is a very expansive park but the primary hike is in a central area near the Lodge. You can easily see Bryce on a day trip, unlike Zion, which can keep you entertained with hikes for days; but it is worth seeing because it is so unusual. We stayed until dark to appreciate the dark sky experience, but we had a full moon, which actually interfered with the experience."

     "comment": "Many travelers, ourselves included, plan Bryce Canyon as a \"day trip\" from Zion. What a mistake we made. First off, it takes about 2 hours to get there, after you get through the main entrance of Zion. It is an absolutely incredible drive, for sure, but you can't get to Bryce early enough to catch the sunrise over the amphitheater or try to get ahead of the crowds. (Sunset would have been an option, but did not relish the idea of navigating the windy canyon roads after dark.) Definitely not as crowded as Zion, but the most popular trail, Navajo Loop, was jammed at 930 AM on a Thursday in April (see separate review.) After our hike, we drove further into the park, and the traffic thinned out considerably. There are so many wonderful hikes at Bryce with views that are incredible and vastly different than Bryce. Red Canyon State Park down the road also looks amazing. If you are planning Zion and Bryce, and you want to hike at Bryce, do yourself a favor and get lodging for a night or two right outside the park or at the lodge or campgrounds."

Make sure you check out a sunrise at sunrise point or walk the many trails this park has to offer to see the splendor of the orange spires/hoodoos or ride a mule to the inner parts of the Canyon with a guide.. On a clear night, go to any of the overviews and see thousands of stars. This is one of the darkest areas in North America, it is amazing. In the summer though, take plenty of water.

     "comment": "Bryce wasn't the first park that popped into my head when thinking about National Parks, but it definitely is now on the top of my favorite parks list. My husband and I spent a day and a half at this park and I loved every moment of it.\nThe sunrise at Bryce Point was just amazing, it's definitely inspiring and relaxing to see the sun come up and change the appearance of the hoodoos in the Bryce Amphitheater. We didn't get to see the sunset, but I think it would've been equally as amazing. I loved Inspiration Point and the Natural Bridge, just standing there in the serene stillness and thinking about how these natural pieces were formed was very special.\nIt's not a very big park and it's definitely doable in a day. If you get a chance, stop by the visitors center and speak to the ranger to ask about Sunsets and Sunrise and their recommendations of where to go. Getting those tips, definitely made the visit so much easier and catching everything we wanted to see.\nSince Bryce Canyon is out in the middle of no where and the closest town is about 30 minutes away, you may want to consider bringing food and snacks. There are general stores around but if you're not wanting to pay those prices and prefer you're own selection of food, it's easier to just bring it in a cooler or stored in your car."

The elevation is from about 7700 - 8500, so plan accordingly; the weather can change quickly. We had sunshine, strong wind, and snow in April. Because we only had one day, we did not hike down into the canyon, but I would have loved to. There are even horse tours that looked fun. Parking in the park itself is very limited, so take the free trams which run about every 15 minutes. The drivers are very nice."

The completely unique geological features of the windows and hoodoos were amazing to see and the scale of the canyon is breathtaking. We hiked the Queens Garden trail and the Navajo Trail and stopped in at both Sunrise and Sunset Point. There is parking at most of the stops but on a busy day it is best to park once and ride the shuttle between stops.

At the south end you have great views of the Great Staircase that starts here and ends at the Grand Canyon and some good hoodoos. We stopped at about one half of the pull outs and view points.

     "comment": "Like most of our National Parks, this one gets crowded. Bring along your patience and consideration of others. When you arrive at the park you are given a map. If you have not made any plans while in the park prior to arriving, you will want to spend some time looking at the map and determining what your goals are while you are there. If you have minimal amount of time in Bryce you will probably want to catch as many of the major viewpoints as possible. If you have more time, you may want to walk or hike one of the many trails in the park. Some trails are easy and others require some serious effort. Choose a trail that works for you. We had a short day and a half in the area and immediately set out goals on seeing all the vista points. We drove to each location and experienced only some minor difficulties with parking. If a parking area is full, move on to the next viewpoint. Don't waste time waiting for a parking spot. The Sunrise and Sunset vista points are the most and consistently crowded. There are great trails at these locations and I would advise you to get there early. Some of the trails here are up to 8 miles. You can understand that people who park here may be there for the entire day. Parking spots may open up but they are few and far between. Each view is unique in it's own way and worthy of a stop. We chose to take the Bristlecone Trail which is at the highest elevation in the park. The trail is partially paved and does have some inclines but for the most part this is an easy trail. It's about 1 - 1 1/2 mile loop and offers some amazing views. Take this trail at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery at every turn. It is spectacular. Bring along lots of water and if it's sunny, some sun screen and a wide brim hat are advisable. Some areas offer some views that may cause a little anxiety for someone who has a fear of heights. Just look the other way in those areas and you will be fine. I tried to capture many of these areas in photos but nothing compares to being physically present in the surroundings. You will be awestruck. Support our National Parks. They are treasures to be shared for generations."

You can do a rim hike but I highly recommend walking down into the valley to experience the change in perspective. Be warned that is is much easier to walk down that it is to walk back up and the return hike can be very tiring! For a longer walk than just down and up do the peek-a-boo loop"

     "comment": "Since the Civilian Conservation Corps labored during the 1930s to build tourism infrastructure in this remote National Park, Bryce Canyon has been among the most popular, with good reason. Seeing photos simply can't do it justice. There's something inexplicably moving about confronting the palette of dramatic colors, the variety of stone textures and the sheer drama of vistas from the rim of the canyon.\nThe popularity of Bryce Canyon is both its blessing and its curse. The park is among the best organized in the country, with outstanding, efficient, frequent and environmentally friendly free shuttle service to every major vista point. But the park's popularity also means it gets crowded in summer. We visited in April, after the spring break rush, which proved a good time to be at Bryce. The traffic pattern for personal vehicles is likewise well planned. I strongly recommend driving to the southernmost viewpoint upon entering the park, then working your way northward again through the day, because all the viewpoints are along the northbound traffic lane. Hiking trail markings are clear, and there are trails suitable for every fitness level, from multi-day backpacking adventures to less-than-a-mile strolls along paved and level paths... all with incredible views and countless memorable photo opportunities. The visitors center is small, but highly informative; rangers smilingly answer the same questions day-after-day from visitors, and a variety of publications offer more than enough information about the park for anyone from a casual tourist to a scientific expert. Enormous new solar panels outside the visitors center follow the sun and offer an up-close lesson to youngsters about renewable energy.\nWe especially enjoyed an easy 1-mile morning walk along Bristlecone Loop at the far southern viewpoint, where stunning high-level views of the canyon were interspersed with tranquil pine forest scenes in an area devastated by fire in 2009. On this walk, you'll see a living Bristlecone tree that's 1,600 years old! Don't miss the Bryce Amphitheater, either; it's not a \"theater,\" but an enormous stone formation comprised of thousands of multicolor \"hoodoos.\" Inspiration Point offers both a short, easy walk and a strenuous climb to an even higher overlook. Natural Bridge is famous for its huge red arch formation, but equally impressive are the views from Bryce Point and Paria View.\nThe park offers camping and a lodge, but limited facilities are booked up months - or a year - in advance. It's very possible to \"do\" Bryce Canyon in a single day, as long as you stick to the rim viewpoints and are not planning any of the arduous, long hikes. Bring lunch, if you can. Food service is somewhat limited. If you can swing it, try staying for dinner at the Bryce Canyon Lodge; the dining room does not offer any views of the canyon, but the food and service is quite good, if on the pricey side.\nBryce Canyon National Park is among the most expensive in the system, but it's well worth the $30 entry fee per vehicle."

We were able to view the entire park in about 3 hours. At the beginning of the park there is the sunrise area which has a hike that goes down into the canyon. That was really neat but you need to be in a little bit of shape to handle it. Plus if its been rainy or snowy - it definitely is muddy at the bottom."

The shuttle buses were not running so parking was tight at a few spots.\nI'd recommend the Fairyland loop trail (8 mi. TH to TH and a moderate to hard hike). The views are spectacular and it isn't too crowded.\nBe aware that you are at 7000 to 9800 ft elevation which makes normal activities (walking, hiking) harder and the UV rays stronger."

We parked at Sunrise Point fairly early in the morning and had the trails below the rim almost to ourselves which was awesome. Even mid afternoon it wasn’t overwhelmingly crowded like Zion. In Spring it’s pretty cold overnight so bring warm clothes until the sun reaches the bottom of the canyon. Great place to star gaze at night. There are no street lights at night so you don’t even need to leave a parking lot to see a ton of stars."

We did not check out queens garden loop ( heard is another beauty) We were wiped out from hiking in Zion the day before.\nNo food choices in Bryce. We went in with “0” expectations for that.

     "comment": "We would recommend the Mossy Cave trail, which is out of the park. Much smaller crowd. Easy hike. water in awesome rocks. Great.\n2nd, the spring break crowd at Bryce is a huge issue. They basically don't think it is economically worth it to staff things 100% until May 1st (start of summer). So you run on a skeleton crew, for a 150% capacity crowd. Yeah. You can see how that ends.\nSunsets at Bryce....don't really happen, so stay at the lodge.\nSunrise...awesome. Don't miss it.\nIf you do the Navajo - Queen Loop, go counterclock wise. There is a HUGE difference in hike intensity. Counterclockwise = gradual climb. Clockwise has a 1 mile grind up a steep....and I mean steep.....slope.\nIf it is crowded, get up early, go to the trails during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Zig while they zag. They are predictable sheep in a big heard. One thing that did surprise me....they wall wake up late. The real crowd doesn't arrive until about 10 am.\nAlso, there is no shuttle until May 1st. read some other bogus review saying there was a shuttle. There is no shuttle."

The NPS staff was AMAZING at the Visitor's Center and a \"shout out\" goes to Ranger Emily who was super friendly during our visit to the Visitor's Center but who also took the time prior to our visit to send a hand-written note and information about the Hike the Hoodoos program to us.

There is never enough time on a bus tour, and we only saw Sunset Canyon. Was very disappointed not to see the Ampitheater and other spots in BC. I recommend spending 1 - 1 1/2 days to see BC, definitely with a minimum of one night stay. Also, going on Sunset Canyon, please keep in mind that the deeper you go into the canyon, the harder it is to come back up. It is an 8,000 foot elevation and the air is thin. It is very easy to meander the downward direction into the canyon, but going back up is a different story. But I'm sure for people who are physically fit, it is a no brainer. Have fun!"

We loved our picture at this spot the Best in all Bryce Canyon...near sunset & a sight I will never forget! A return trip in February 2018 rewarded us with a snow view of the Canyon...Breathtaking!

The wind sculptures and bright red sandstone pillars and castles are awesome to behold. We hiked the Queens Garden trail and I took hundreds of pictures just there in minutes. What a great place to reflect on life. Special thanks goes out to our leaders in the late 1800 and early 1900s who had the foresight to preserve these gifts for future generations!"

Utah is probably the most magnificent place we have ever visited. We did 5 National Parks in three days, all very different and all spectacular. Only one criticism, concessions are available for US citizens while visitors who have travelled from further away have to pay full price. That is racial discrimination. It’s the same in all Parks."

It seemed that everyone who arrived at this overlook was silent as well in awe of the scene before them. We were there when there was still snow on the ground and landscape and to us, it just added to the beauty. Bryce is a small park ... only 56 square miles, so it's really easy to navigate. We followed a recommendation to head directly up the main road to the top observation area of Rainbow Point (about 30-35 minutes from the entrance) and then came back down, allowing us to avoid left-hand turns into and out of the lookouts. This seems especially useful when the park has even more traffic in the summer/peak visiting times. At the top of our list of favorite national parks!"

Whether you hike through the hoodoos or choose to just drive to the various viewpoints in your car, you won't be disappointed. The best view points are Natural Arch, Sunrise Point, Sunset Point and Inspiration Point. We were here during a Spring break visit and it was fairly crowded then, so summer visitors will probably experience even bigger crowds and more traffic than we did. The throngs of people can be a little overwhelming and frustrating, so time your visit according to your patience level. Use the shuttles if they are running. Bryce Canyon is a true natural masterpiece, though, and should not be missed if you are in southern Utah."

Follow the Navajo Loop Trail for an intimate visit with the Canyon. Be sure to carry plenty of water. There is little shade and the air is dry. ***NOTE: If you are hiking in July and August, head out very early in the day as monsoons often pop up seemingly out of nowhere most days around 11:30. They contain heavy rain, which makes hiking extremely dangerous, hazardous lightening and rounds of pelting hail. Also, hiking out by way of Wall Street is only for those in good physical shape."

We didn't have a lot of time to spend there (just a stop on our way to an AZ art show), but were able to see nearly every major stop on this enormous orange canyon. To me, it was more impressive than the western part of the Grand Canyon and also Zion (which, because of time constraints and physical limitations, we were not able to hike and fully enjoy). If you can't make the hikes at Zion, and must choose between Zion & Bryce, I'd choose Bryce. Don't get me wrong, Zion is breath-taking and a must-see, but this is quicker with fewer lines, and you can drive to many points of interest, which you can't in Zion. There are also walking trails here as in Zion, but they're probably shorter."

     "comment": "We have visited over half of the U.S. national parks and monuments and Bryce Canyon is at the top of our list of favorites. The bright coral-colored hoodoos that populate this area of southern Utah are like nowhere else. While the park itself is located in a remote area, once you've arrived at the park the viewpoints, trails and services are easy to access. We visited in mid-September and the weather was perfect. The park was quite busy but we still managed to find some solitude in the southern section (I don't think the commercial tour buses go there). We stayed at the Best Western Grand Hotel (see separate review) at Bryce Canyon City, just outside the park entrance, and spent one full day in the park. We got up early and ate breakfast at the hotel, then drove our personal vehicle into the park at sunrise ($30/car valid 7 days, accepts NPS passes). The scenic drive (Route 63) skirts along the rim of the Bryce Amphitheater for 18 miles and there are about 15 viewpoints or overlooks along the way (see below). Not much is visible from the car so in most places you have to stop and get out, but the walking distances are short. The majority of the viewpoint walkways are paved and suitable for wheelchairs or strollers. We drove all the way to the south end of the scenic drive at Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point first (about 18 miles one-way), and it was very quiet when we were there - we only saw one other gentleman. We then worked our way back north to Bryce Canyon Lodge, stopping at the sights along the way. There weren't any crowds until we reached Bryce Point and Inspiration Point; these were much busier since the shuttle buses go there. We ate lunch at the lodge (see separate review), visited the gift shop for souvenirs, and then walked on the Rim Trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point, and on the Navajo Loop Trail into the hoodoos (that .5 mile section of the Rim Trail is paved and wheelchair-accessible but the 1.3 mile, moderately-difficult Navajo Loop is not). Next we drove to Fairyland Point overlook (just inside the park entrance), then visited Mossy Cave Trail (outside the park entrance on Scenic Highway 12, 1 mile easy round-trip footpath to small waterfall and grotto, not wheelchair-accessible).\nSome Points of Interest, north to south, on Bryce Canyon Scenic Drive* (* indicates attraction has a separate Tripadvisor page):\nMM0 Bryce Canyon entrance sign: parking for photos\nFairyland Point*, turn east .3 mile past park entrance sign on 1 mile spur road to overlook and Fairyland Loop Trail, Rim Trail*\nMM1 Visitor Center (next to entrance station): maps, information, souvenirs, restroom\nMM1.2 North Campground: picnic area, general store, showers, laundry, restroom, Rim Trail*\nMM2 Bryce Canyon Lodge*: restaurant*, information, souvenirs, horseback excursions, paved Rim Trail* to overlooks at Sunrise Point* (Queens Garden Trail) and Sunset Point*\nMM2.2 Sunset Point* Parking: overlook, picnic area, restroom, Thor's Hammer* formation, Rim Trail*, Navajo Loop Trail*\nMM2.4 Sunset Campground\n[Note Inspiration Point, Bryce Point and Paria View are on a 2-mile spur road, turn at MM2.8. Trailers aren't permitted at Bryce Point and Paria View]\nInspiration Point*: overlook, Rim Trail*, restroom\nBryce Point* (no trailers): overlook, Rim Trail*, Peekaboo Loop Trail, Under-the-Rim Trail\nParia View (no trailers): overlook\nMM4.5 Picnic area on west side\nMM6.2 Swamp Canyon: overlook, Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon trails connect to Under-the-Rim Trail\nMM9.5 Picnic area on west side\nMM10.6 Farview Point*: overlook, restroom, footpath 1018' to Piracy Point\nMM12.4 Natural Bridge*: overlook\nMM13.8 Agua Canyon*: overlook\nMM14.8 Ponderosa Canyon*: overlook, Agua Canyon Trail connects to Under-the-Rim Trail\nMM16.3 Black Birch Canyon: overlook\nMM17.9 Yovimpa Point*: overlook, paved walkway 1200' to Rainbow Point\nMM18 Rainbow Point*: overlook, picnic area, restroom, paved walkway 1200' to Yovimpa Point, Bristlecone Loop Trail, Under-the-Rim Trail, Riggs Spring Loop Trail\nIf you don't have a lot of time, I suggest driving into the north part of the park and stopping at Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, Bryce Point, and Paria Point. These sites are close together and offer amazing views of the hoodoos in the amphitheater. At Sunset Point there is the opportunity to walk down among the formations, such as Thor's Hammer. These are popular areas, so try to go early in the day if you can because the parking fills up.\nBetween mid-April and the end of October there is a free shuttle that operates between Bryce Canyon City (Ruby's Inn*) and the main points of interest in the north end of the park. The wheelchair-accessible buses run every 15 minutes from 8:00am to 6:00pm or 7:00pm depending on the season. Parking is available at Bryce Canyon City if you want to leave your vehicle and ride the shuttle into the park (you still have to pay entrance fee). The shuttle stops at: Ruby's Inn, Grand Hotel, Ruby's Campground, Bryce Canyon Visitor Center, Sunset Campground, Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Bryce Canyon Lodge, and Sunrise Point. Note that the shuttle does not go further south on the scenic drive (Route 63) past the turn-off for Inspiration Point and Bryce Point. However, half-day bus tours that go all the way to Rainbow Point are available twice a day (reservations required); call 435-834-5290 or inquire at the shuttle station or Ruby's Inn in Bryce Canyon City.\nThere is a paved multi-use path that goes from Bryce Canyon City/Ruby's Inn to Inspiration Point (about 5 miles one-way). This path goes past the visitor center, North Campground, Bryce Canyon Lodge, Sunset Point and Sunset Campground. It's possible to park or stay at Bryce Canyon City and ride a bicycle into the park (entrance fee applies). Rentals are available at Ruby's Inn.\nLodging and camping is available both inside the park and just outside the park entrance at Bryce Canyon City or at the nearby towns of Tropic and Cannonville. The park is very popular so the accommodations stay booked up; reserve as far in advance as possible. A wide variety of recreational activities and programs are available both in and around Bryce Canyon; inquire at Ruby's Inn and the park visitor center.\nThe elevation at Bryce Canyon varies between 7700 and 9100 feet. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness (fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, etc.). Take it easy and drink plenty of fluids.\nNote that pets must be attended and leashed. They are only permitted on paved trails and surfaces."

Be sure to see that canyon at sunrise and sunset for incredible views and amazing photos.\nThe paths are very narrow and a small slip or misstep can land you way down at the bottom of the canyon.

     "comment": "This park is extremely easy to navigate, one road in and out. We went in mid-September thinking that most of the crowds would have died down. We were very wrong. As always, we hit the park shortly after sun-up. We managed to get to the Navajo Loop and complete the trail before it got too busy. On our return back up from the bottom of the canyon we notices many more visitors gathering at the top of the canyon. We continued on along the Rim Trail and were stunned by the amount of people. There were so many that it actually made the loop difficult to navigate, so we hopped back in the car and went to the next overlook. By the time we got back in the car, the parking lot was full. Numerous tourist buses were disembarking passengers and it made it hard to get in and out of parking areas for the remainder of the trip thru the park.\nSome of the viewing areas are basically peep holes in between stands of trees. We were unable to get to some of the lookouts due to other visitors monopolizing them. We tried to ask politely to be excused as we tried to pass on the paths but due to language barriers (or just rudeness) they declined our request. Keeping this in mind, please remember to get a good look, take your photos and move on so all can see."

It's a very nice drive with a lot of view points, but we enjoyed the Amphitheater the most.\nDon't skip this park when your in the neighborhood. It's a must do.

When the sun hits the rocks they glow. It is so beautiful. We spent the day there and saw just about everything. There are plenty of hiking trails or you can drive from beautiful view the beautiful view. We were there in early February. It was cold but enjoyable. There was very little snow on the ground but I think there is normally more that time of year. The shuttle bus was not running so we were able to drive our own vehicle into the park. We were there on the weekend and it was not too crowded (maybe because it was 20 degrees). I definitely recommend this park."

     "comment": "Bryce earns its place as one of the top 5 National Parks in Utah. Requires at least 1/2 day and best to have a full day. The road is scenic, but it is essential to viewing the world-class scenery by parking at the various overlooks (\"Points\"), getting out and walking variable distances to the canyon rim, typically 100-300ft distances. Most are doable with canes or modern wheelchairs. Well advised, if able, to take at least a short hike down to develop perspective of the landscape and hoodoos. Even 400-500ft would open a landscape page. At night, be sure to walk or drive away from lights to see the best display of the Milky Way in the 48 states (it's furthest from cities). Foreigners especially who never see the Milky Way Must do this, as so many have never seen this miracle. If short on time, then better to not drive the length of the road south and instead, e.g.: 1) visit Sunset Point, 2) Inspiration Point, 3) hike down from Sunset or another point such as Sunrise. Caution on hikes down: harder on knees, but at least 4x harder on heart/lungs on the return trip up. The elevation is 8-9K, so it is also much cooler than lower elevations such as Zion, so clothing choices have to be considered."

There is a new hike the hoodoos challenge. You hike and find the hoodoos take a pic of you with it or a rubbing and return to the ranger station for a patch. Our adult group enjoyed the hunt and find! Snowshoeing here in the winter is our favorite and especially when there is a full moon. The white against the red back drop is lovely. If you have people with you who do not hike there are locations to park and walk a short 300 yards to worthwhile and scenic overviews."

These lithic (rock) giants were formed from Cretaceous period limestone, siltstone, dolomite, and mudstone which are the types of rock comprising the varied shapes the Claron Formation exposed here for hikers to get up close. Several trails take you above, below and among the pastel colored pillars called hoodoos in some places because of their shapes. Flash floods are a concern in the wet season because of the steep sided slot canyons and extensive breadth of these watersheds over which the rain may fall. Some rocks the size of cars suggest the power of ice and water on these millions of year old weathered rocks."

It was very cold the day we went - the temperature never topped 20F, and most of the time was much colder. Too much snow on the ground to do any hiking, so we just enjoyed the various scenic lookouts. The scenery is just as beautiful in winter as in summer. The advantage of being here in the off season is that there is very little traffic, and not a lot of people crowding around the viewpoints. Be aware that some roads or walking paths may be closed, and most of the restrooms are closed."

We loved sunrise and sunset and hiking the many trails in the park. I struggle with altitude living at sea level my entire life. Be aware that this park reaches to 9000 ft in some areas. The winds can be strong as well. My husband did well on several of the hikes and had no trouble with the altitude, as usual. ;D"

     "comment": "We did a one night stay here in early December '17, and Bryce has stayed the distance as having the most memorable views in our Zion-Bryce-Page-Monument Valley-Grand Canyon circuit. It's something I'll never forget. Three reasons we loved it:\n1. The hoodoos - these columnar, gothic cathedral spire-like rock formations, carved by water and ice, were like nothing I'd ever seen before. The pinky-orange and white landscape looked other-wordly, and the interspersing of these pastel rock spires with conifer trees and a glorious blue sky overhead was unbelievably beautiful and any photographer's dream. While I'm quite pleased with some of my photos, none of them do justice to the sheer 'wow factor' of this canyon. I'll never forget my first view out over the hoodoos from Sunrise Point, a short walk from the car park. By the time we'd walked over to Sunset Point a few minutes away (the better view, for me), I was completely blown away by it. I don't think I'd ever get tired of looking at Bryce canyon. You'd see something new every time. I'm usually cold if it gets to less than 10C. I stood for over 90 minutes in -4C temperatures, cold but mesmerised.\n2. The sunset/sunrise - Certainly in late early Dec, you want to be prepared to be standing around in the cold. It's a good deal colder than Zion or Page either side of it, and I was glad of the full layers, thick coat, scarf, hat and gloves. I'd really recommend having gloves you can use your phone wearing, as it stops you getting quite so cold taking photos. We saw both a sunrise and a sunset, and the sunset was the winner for me. I'd looked up the time and sunset was at 5.10pm, so we arrived at 4pm and walked over to Sunset Point, to set up a tripod. Actually, some of the best photos we got were with our phones. The important thing was not to assume the colours of the sunset would arrive right on the time sunset was forecasted. A lot of people were looking round as the sun finally disappeared at 5.10pm, and thinking 'is that it?' Some people left. I couldn't see how a sky as clear as that and a sun as bright as that couldn't give as a pretty view, so we dug in and waited. It was probably~20 mins (felt like hours in the cold) after the sun had gone that the sky started to do its thing. Then it moved pretty quickly. The sky first went an amazing pinky-purple, and then a deep orange (see photos). The effect of the light over the hoodoos was breathtaking. We kept looking at each other like we'd wake up at any moment. Well worth the wait. Our hands and feet were frozen as we stomped back to the car to warm up, but it was 100% worth it. The night sky, with lots of stars on the walk back to the car, was fab too. Sunrise was good, also at Sunset Point, and I went down the start of the Navajo trail to take pictures of Thor's Hammer as the sun came up (see photos). It wasn't quite as dramatic as sunset, but still pretty cool as the sun first clipped the top of the hoodoos. I'd expected the 'Thor's Hammer' hoodoo to stand out a mile, but there are so many strange and unlikely shapes in these stone pillars that it wasn't that obvious.\n3. The trails - The whole Canyon is laid out as a set of viewing points. Sunrise, Sunset, Observation and Bryce Points are pretty close to the carpark. I'd go for Sunrise and Sunset if no other. Sunrise first gives the sheer size of the Canyon. Sunset is soooo pretty. We drove up to all the other points in the car, hopping out for a look. They are variations on a theme, but I'd definitely recommend the Natural Bridge. That is really different, and very cool. We walked Navajo trail from Sunset Point as we were time-limited. It's a bit over 2km and you walk down a big slope and then back up it. The views were very worthwhile. You pass through quite different sections of landscape, from walking down a fabulous path between towering red cliffs, to getting close to the hoodoos. Some bits are wooded, some are all about the rock. The final slog back up was a bit tiring, and all those layers can work against you at that point (we had to stop and de-layer several times as the sun rose), but I loved it and wished we'd had time to walk more in this area. That said, if it's cold or you're not inclined to walk far, you can just drive and look, drive and look.\nWe stayed at Ruby's Best Western (perfectly fine) and that was a short drive away, which was perfect for nipping up to the canyon for an early start, and getting back quickly afterwards to thaw. If you are considering having Bryce on your itinerary, I really can't recommend it enough. It's completely unforgettable. We arrived mid- afternoon (to enjoy the drive from Zion in the day - a fab drive) and did the sunset on our first evening. The next day we got up and did the sunrise at just before 7am and the Navajo Loop walk, which took us to about 11am. We then spent a good 2.5 hours driving up the rest of the trail, to look at the other points including the fab Natural Bridge, leaving the Canyon at about 1.30-2pm for our drive on to Page, arriving early evening. An extra day here, or even half day, would have been brilliant as I wanted to do more walking."

It's just an easy park to visit and has a lot of bang for your buck in terms of easily accessible views. If you have the opportunity to visit, definitely do it."

Watch the sunrise from the sunset point of the park to look at the panoramic view. Two days at the park will be all you need to cover all the views points and some decent hikes."

There are hikes for all levels- easy ones for older folks or those in wheelchairs to beautiful vistas and 10+ mile ones for experienced hikers. It's stunningly beautiful in winter and almost empty of tourists.\nStop by the welcome center when you enter the park for a great exhibit on the geology of the park and how it formed over 100's of millions of years."

I recommend hiking the Navajo Loop Trail. Beautiful hike down amongst the hoodoos. This trail can get muddy and slippery so be prepared, wear proper shoes and hiking pole can be helpful. Great picnicking areas, views, gift shop and museum. Not much lodging outside this park. So if your planning on staying here plan ahead. Very nice hotel just outside park entrance. This park is pretty remote. So get your supplies before hand. If hiking don't forget your water and snacks."

I explored the longer Peak-A-Boo Loop on horseback, but that one is also good for hiking if you want to spend an extended time around the hoodoos.\nIt is a 30 min drive from the park entrance to Rainbow Point (which marks the end of the road) with several viewpoints along the way. I took about 2 hours for the round trip which was just enough to briefly stop at all of them and take some pictures.\nAltogether, I had one afternoon and a full day in the park and I got to hike, ride and take the scenic drive which was like everything I wanted to do."

The sun provides charging vistas as the shadows change while it moves across the sky from east to west. Breathtaking. The Natural Bridge is amazing. The crows are friendly. The rim trail is relatively easy hiking. The slope up to upper inspiration point is challenging but it’s worth the effort, take a breath from time to time and duck in the views. See if you can spot the chipmunks - cute.\nAnother amazing National Park."

     "comment": "WOW!!! If you enjoy natural formations and taking pics, this place is paradise. Start out early and see the Sunrise from \"anywhere\" along the Rim from Sunrise to Sunset point !! All great viewing areas!!!! After sunrise head back and fill up on a big breakfast and then head out on a full day hike. I recommend heading down Via Sunrise point and do the Navajo loop Trail to Peekaboo loop trail and come back Via Queens garden. It's a looong full day of hiking but it will leave you endless views and pics. We took over 1,000 pics combined as every few steps u simply can't help but to do a 180 look around to enjoy the incredible scenery. Although a long hike you will be stopping to take tons of pics and get plenty of rest. *Midway thru Peekaboo you will encounter some bathrooms* The hike up is definitely harder than down so just pace yourself and if you are doing in hot temps bring plenty of water 1/2 gallon to a gallon for sure a hat, sunblock and consider an umbrella to shade you ( looks funny but works excellent ) Grab a great meal after rest up and go back to see sunset ** always different every night. This will be your highlight day for sure. Enjoy!!!!"

Absolutely stunning vistas, with reds and pinks and oranges of every hue. We enjoyed the loop drive and stopped at nearly every vista point on our way back. Sunrise and Sunset points were unbelievably gorgeous (tough to find parking) and are forever burned into memory. It definitely ranks up there in our favorite National Park adventures!"

     "comment": "Landed at Bryce from Nephi mid morning. Goal today was to spend most of the day in the canyon area and get some good sunset pictures. We were there in mid September. First recommendation definitely use the shuttle. Parking is free at the shuttle station. Thankfully I have a senior pass for entry. Shuttles were running about every 15 minutes at each stop. Traffic and parking inside the park was congested and many times certain overlook site areas were closed to traffic due to overcrowding of cars. Shuttles however, ran everywhere all the time. First stop was the visitor center then on to Bryce Point as there was a storm moving into the area. After a brief visit at the point got back on the shuttle and almost made in back into the Lodge before the hail storm. We waited for the storm to pass and had lunch at the lodge. As clouds persisted we decided to come back in the early morning to visit the view points and to hike a couple of the trails. Rim trail was being worked on so part of the trail was closed. There are a number of trails available to walk, strenuous to easy, that will fit all. Who knew that rock could be so beautiful. The wonder of hoodoos and rock spires. The colors were brilliant and the formations of stone were inspiring. Depending on the time of day and the cloud coverage color of Bryce Canyon seemed to be always changing. Never did get to see a good sunset at Bryce, so sad."

There was a short trail at the last lookout that was a nice walk in the woods with some incredible overlooks. The arch at the Bridge stop is just amazing to see. Closer to the north end of the park there are some well maintained trails. I recommend the Queens Garden trail as it gives some beautiful views without being a difficult trail."

Although majority of people view it from the rim, the trails going down are majestic. Colors change with time of the day, intense on the sun and subtle in the shade or near sunset. Mix of red-orange-purple-rose-white hoodos, stone castles, creatures, figures, vast valley and high plateaus, deep blue skies, and shimmering greens of ponderosa pines are owe inspiring. Add twisting shapes of bristlecone and ponderosa pines and juniper trees, and you can't stop making pictures as no words can express the feelings."

They give out very useful maps at the entrance. Stop at all the viewpoints you can manage - each one has its own charm. All you have to do is search out internet images of this park - you will see what it's all about. But like many natural features on this earth, being there is the real deal. The scope and depth here is super impressive. You can't take a bad photo. The colors are spectacular. And although we are not hikers, we saw many people far out in the canyon on some cool looking trails. If you're a National Geographic type of traveler, get out there and cross this one off your list!"

You start at the canyon rim and go down steep switchbacks in order to walk among the rock formations — and then, of course, you have to climb back up. Both the slope and the altitude can make this quite a challenge. Pace yourself and drink lots of water. I found the Queen’s Garden trail to be particularly beautiful."

And the park is organized in such a way that visitors can easily drive to the best areas and have a short walk to optimal vantage points.\nFor those who want to venture further, there are some short trails as well. No doubt there are some more extensive trails for the adventuresome hiking enthusiast, but since I was traveling with some older folks we took the easy route. It was easy for us to all enjoy the scenery, in relative comfort."

     "comment": "If you are anywhere near Southern Utah you need to make your way here! We were staying in Springdale by Zion National Park but we had to make the day trip across here to Bryce. You also get to pass by Red Canyon on the way which looks like a mini version of Bryce. Its only a 2 hour drive each way and you get to drive the amazing Zion-Mt Carmel Highway (Route 9) out of Zion which has some of the best views in the World!\nBack to Bryce - the place is one giant Amphitheatre that you get to view from above in all its glory when you arrive if you park at the Sunset Point trail head parking lot. We arrived around 10am on a Saturday in November and it was very quiet at this time, there were lots of parking spaces available.\nThe view from Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point after you complete the Queens Garden/Navajo Trail is just like nothing else on Earth. The photos don’t do it justice you have to experience it for yourself.\nIt is also worth a ten minute drive South down the scenic route 63 to Natural Bridge which has its own parking lot at the side of the road.\nAlthough the elevation is 8000-8600 feet here you don’t feel any lack of oxygen in the air at all, in the Fall anyway and I doubt you would feel light headed unless you are very sensitive to this.\nBryce should really be on your bucket list if it isn’t already!"

We went to all of the parks on our journey (Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Canyonlands, Arches) and this was my favorite. It's so different from Zion - in Zion you in the bottom of the canyon looking up in amazement and hiking up - at Bryce you are on the plateau above the canyon and can see into the canyon and hike down into the canyon among the hoodoos. The stunning colors, the unusual formations, the hikes - you must do a hike if you are able, all make Bryce a site to behold. We stayed in the North campground and watched sunrises and sunsets from the rim and did several hikes along the rim and into the canyon.....am amazing life experience."

We traveled in early November, which is considered the winter off-season, and it was noticeable. Many of the restaurants and hotels were closed. I prefer the lesser crowds at this time of year anyway. If you have just a few hours, then drive to Bryce Point, at the far end of the park, and stop at all the stops on the way back to the main viewing area between Sunrise and Sunset points. If you have more than a few hours, then take the Navajo Trail hike down into the canyon too. It's magnificent to see the hoodoo formations from up close. I would suggest a full day or two half days at this park if you want to see it all. We have visited many national parks and found this one to be as spectacular as the others."

     "comment": "The day we arrived it was 2pm on a ferociously hot afternoon in early September. The parking lot next to the Visitor Center was crammed, with all spaces full and idling cars waiting to pounce on any space that came free. The Visitor Center itself was packed. It was all just like a shopping mall the day before Christmas. So we just grabbed a map and set off for the General Store to get a cold drink after our 5-hour journey. We discovered that all the parking spaces nearer to the Amphitheater were already taken, so we left the car at the Store and set off for the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop Circuit, which was truly spectacular. But once we had completed it in the afternoon heat, we were done for the day. A friendly ranger told us this was not really the best way to do Bryce Canyon, and gave us some tips for the next day.\nSo what a difference we found the next morning. We’d arrived as suggested at 6am this time to take in the view from Sunrise Point, and saw the Amphitheater in a whole new light, with vivid colors that contrasted with the washed-out mid-afternoon light of the day before. A quick breakfast at the nearby lodge and then straight to the far end of the park at Yovimpa Point, where it was still so early that there was nobody there – but still a bit chilly, so take a jacket. Here we took the Bristlecone Loop, but not too fast, as it’s over 9000 feet. Then we worked our way back along the ridge (despite its name, the park is really a ridge overlooking hoodoos on either side) taking in the sights. By 2pm the crowds were back, and we were ready to leave the madness behind and head to the hotel for a siesta!"

You can drive to inspiration point and sunset point both great lookouts but with limited parking but in peak season the park operates a free shuttle. Be sure to stop at the visitor center."

Definitely take the time to hike among the hoodoos below the rim, and sunrise viewing is a must. Drive the scenic route to Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail, stop at the viewpoints along the way back including Farview and Natural Bridge. Bryce has such a unique feel and is simply beautiful."

The views stretch out forever to horizons in all directions. We didn't have a lot of time so went only to Sunset Point. It sits high on a ledge overlooking the Amphitheater, so be aware if heights are not your thing. There is some parking spread out throughout the park - and shuttle buses may be the best option when the park is busy. This is an extremely popular NPS location, and there are a ton of hotels, services and camping locations. There also is good handicapped access to the main attractions. Go here for the sights, but don't expect solitude or a rustic atmosphere without investigation and some hiking probably will be involved."

Most of the hotels located directly in the National Park were at the time of our trip already fully booked and some of them were at that time quite expensive; i.e. get the hotel reservation for the high season done well in advance. The hotels in Escalante are apparently very special. We have explored the Bryce Canyon NP following the HWY 12 Scenic Byway. The impressions were overwhelming, again and again new formations, new landscapes, changing of colours. The Bryce Canyon NP offers numerous hiking trails as well as Bike Trails, one of them from Red Canyon along the Hwy 12."

The hoodoo formations are so unique and special, each and everyone different and they change color over the course of the day. Just walking a few feet gives you a whole new perspective and view. One could literally take thousands of pictures here and not get bored - very challenging to get a perfect shot. I love sunrise and sunset best when the tips of the hoodoos look like they are glowing. Did a few hikes here too - it's great to see them from below, they are so large and majestic. The color combinations and contrasts here are amazing. It's like a symphony made of rock and limestone. Nature is amazing. Only negative is it can get way too crowded which spoils the experience a little. Go in the off season, or on a weekday, and give yourself at least a full day, preferably two....and go to one of the less crowded lookouts, as they are beautiful too and you might get some solitude too."

You can pretty much do the whole park in one night/1-2 days, with stops at the pull offs as you drive through. The park shuttles were closed for the season, so we drove through. Stop for a few hikes, which vary in intensity. Beautiful park. The Best Western Grand is the only place you should stay!"

The park rangers had the telescopes out from 9:00 to 10:30 pm and showed us the different stars and constellations. It was so great! The rangers were very informative and it was amazing to see the craters of the moon so closely! I can't wait to come back!"

     "comment": "The “hoodoos” are so characteristic of this park and for good reason.\nThe views from different points of the park and trails changes with every bend and with every hour of the day and changing sunlight.\nIf you are short on time or don’t want to hike a lot, then choose the queens trail canyon - a moderate 2.3 miles hike which takes you up close to the hoodoos. Carry alight jacket in and after oct as it tends to get cold at the bottom, when all sun is blocks by steep cliffs.\nThe best sunset I think is from the Inspiration point rather than the namesake “ Sunset point”\nA word of caution - the gift shop at Ruby s Inn, right at the park entrance is exorbitantly priced for Knick knacks and mementoes. Try and buy them in any of the major towns nearby. If driving to Vegas, Kanab downtown has wonderful shops where the same things can be found with much more variety and significantly cheaper."

These HOODOOs were absolutely amazing and our tour company gave us plenty of opportunities to view these geological wonders. It seems as if each National or State Park we went to on this tour was better than the last & sometimes I am overwhelmed by the wonders of our natural forces of weather (even though I taught both Biology & Earth Science).

We drove to the end and stopped on our way back which seemed to work in our favor. The altitude is high and can cause some issues for those who are sensitive. It was also cold and windy so be prepared. There are several trails down into the canyon for the adventurous, but not for us. We were more than happy on top.\nThere is a nice information center and the Bryce Canyon Lodge inside the park is beautiful. They have a great gift shop,restrooms and restaurant. It is vey crowded and difficult to get in so book well in advance of your trip.\nEveryone should experience this National Park."

     "comment": "Compared with Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon felt a bit more personal. You stay a little closer to nature, there are walks to the the floor of the canyon that are not too strenous. The hoodoos and the warm red-ocre colouring is unique and beautiful. We stayed for two nights in order to catch a sunrise, tour the sightseeing points by car and go down in the canyon. We got the very useful tip to descend via the steep Navajo Trail and take the less steep Queens garden trail up - that way is definitely best. And it was well worth it to out in the cold morning to watch the spectacular sunrise over the Canyon - it is a short walk from the lodging."

     "comment": "Stopped here on a bus tour of 3 of the 5 main Utah Parks. Had only 1 hour and 50 minutes at the main canyon rim. It has a visitor center with flush toilets. Parking lot was crowded with tour buses and tourist vehicles. Located near the park's Lodge.\nThis is a federal national park so there is an entry fee per car.\nRock formations look like gigantic termites ate into the sandstone formations. It is about 0.8 miles down to bottom. There are NO railings or fencing along the switch back trails. If you slip and fall, it can be a long way down. I only had time to go halfway down. The rim is about a 1/2 mile hike along the edge. There are scheduled ranger talks about the park conducted along the rim.\nThe view is superb. If you have about 4-5 hours then you can easily hike down, along the bottom trails and back up again to the parking lot.\nWarning: If you hike down, there are no outhouses or water sources along the trails."

This is a truly unique place on the face of the earth, and I feel blessed to have been able to experience it. Be forewarned, you are at 9,000 feet or so on the rim, so hiking is different here.

We opted for the easier walks round the amphitheatre edges rather than hiking down into the canyon but even with this the views were spectacular with plenty to see. We spent sunrise on bryce point which was worth the early start, although gets busy so arrive early for your spot. Also drove the scenic drive, this gave a different perspective although perhaps not as stunning as the amphitheatre itself. The facilities were good throughout and the transport system effective. We spent 2 days/2 nights in the area and without the amphitheatre walks felt this was enough to see the highlights."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon’s proximity to so many other amazing places (Vegas, Page, Zion) makes it a great and easily reachable destination. We stayed the night in Panguitch and it was an easy drive in. The park is fairly small and we only spent half a day there although I’m sure you could spend a couple of days happily. It’s not as large and doesn’t have quite as much to see as some of the other, more famous, parks such as Zion, Yosemite and Yellowstone where you can easily spend 3-5 days. Regardless, it’s a lovely park that’s easy to get to, get in and park at. As we only had half a day, we did the Navajo loop trail that takes you around the rim briefly and then down into the hoodoos and (most impressively) down Wall St and back out again. The views are incredible and unlike anything I’ve seen before. It can get steep at times and very hot if you do it at midday - bring water. You can either take it clockwise (turn left when you enter) or anti-clockwise (turn right). We went clockwise although it seemed most went the other way. Allow 1-2 hours for the hike. The start of the trail is well signposted from sunset point parking lot, where there are also good toilet facilities.\nA very enjoyable visit and I would like to return to try some of the other hikes."

We stopped and got out of the bus at various locations where Jay explained the geology, some history, flora and fauna at each place.\nTo book the tour just go to the 'shuttle bus' window next to the main entrance of Ruby's Inn. Choose your preferred time, 9am or 1.30pm and show your Park Pass. There are a number of pick-up points outside hotels, campgrounds and visitor centre.\nIt was a very worthwhile trip and it was free!

Bryce will cost you $30 to enter... if you have the entire day, it probably is a good idea to take the free shuttle bus around... by 1300 on an October weekday, some of the viewpoint carparks were already full... But I had really limited time so kept my car.... stopped at just two viewpoints and walked hard! Stunning rock formations, views of around 100 miles and like Red, once you got 10 minutes from the parking, it was largely empty. Literally breathtaking - you're up at near 9000 feet and there's 30% less oxygen than you're used to...!\nTake the best camera you can because smartphone cameras just don't capture how wonderful this place is.\nMy day here (and a Grand Canyon visit) make me want to spend 2 weeks travelling the National Parks around here.

The free shuttle is worth using, we caught it to Bryce Point (8296 feet above sea level) and walked back along the rim via Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Sunrise Point, at the stop we went down on the Queens Garden Trail to Queen Victoria which was 1.8 miles to the end and 357 feet down, of course then you have to walk back up but worth it. We then walked to the General store for an ice cream and then walked over to The Visitor Centre to catch the shuttle back to Ruby’s Inn. The easiest walk along the rim is from Bryce Point as it is mainly flat or downhill, you can stop at any point and catch the shuttle which run every 10/15 minutes. Stunning views around every corner of the “Canyon wall or fin”, “Windows” and “Hoodoos”."

Carry water.\nThat hike plus stops at every one of the viewpoints right up to the end of the road took us all day, leaving the park as dusk approached. You could do the park in less time if you just stick to the viewpoints closer to the park gates."

     "comment": "After visiting Bryce twice in the last few months with two different groups I would like to pass along a couple of tips which might be helpful. I experienced Bryce two ways: all day at the park and a half day. If you are limited for time and only doing a half day unless you get there very early I would park your car at the visitor center and then take the shuttle to either Inspiration Point or Sunset Point. You can then walk along the trail at the top of the canyon. This is a paved walkway with many amazing vistas. The main reason for taking the shuttle is that the parking lot at Sunset Point fills up quickly and you don't want to be wasting time looking for a parking space when you could be viewing the canyon. If you have time remaining you could then drive further up into the park to different viewpoints. If limited for time I don't suggest driving any further than the Natural Bridge.\nIf you have all day and are in halfway decent shape you should definitely do the Queen's/Navaho Loop Trail. Going down into the canyon give you a completely different perspective of this beautiful park. I would suggest starting at Sunset Point and ending at Sunrise. That way you go down through the canyon which I believe makes it more dramatic.\nIf you are anywhere near this park make sure you stop even if it is for a short period ot time. You will be stunned and amazed at the beauty."

Develop a good plan and talk to people before you set out or you will do a lot of unnecessary walk. Maybe OK if you are young but not if you are a senior citizen."

The shuttle will take you directly to all of the park's viewpoints, so you will not have to spend time circling the small lots waiting to park. This is also a great park for people with limited mobility. While there are numerous trails of varying degrees of difficulty that you can hike should you choose, you do not have to do so to see most of the park's points of interest. This park is truly a must-see!"

Try to arrive before sunrise as the light from the early dawn makes for a memorable viewing. The trails at this national park are well manicured and very fun to traverse. The trails do have a lot of twist and turns and elevation changes so you will get some good exercise. Take it slow though as there is something to see for every turn of the head. Next time I visit I will save 2 days to enable leisurely hikes exploring all the beautiful scenery. Go visit this national park!"

Unlike the Grand Canyon which is very far to the bottom, visitors can walk through Bryce Canyon without too much difficulty. The area around Bryce Canyon is a combination of ranches and small towns, and it's a pleasant drive from Kanab, Utah. We got there early and it was very cold but there were not too many people there. There were plenty of parking spaces. The sign at the beginning of the park stated that parking was limited and you should take the shuttle bus. That was true at Zion but not for Bryce."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon can only be described as one of the natural wonders of the world. The largest selection of hoodoos anywhere to be seen. It is strictly not a Canyon as it has only one side however it consists of many canyons or amphitheaters. The colours range from subtle pinks to vermillion and palest creams. It's soaring crags and shapes are highlighted by the Pinion and Ponderosa pines which grow on the Canyon floors. Winding their way through these sandstone edifices are countless trails which are easily accessed by walkers who do so in their hundreds. The blue skies assensuate the towering sandstone pillars giving the whole spectacle a wonderful 3D effect. To add to this natural wonder is the wonderful sense of silence you feel walking through this incredible landscape. Use the free shuttle service which is a hop on hop off bus allowing you to enjoy the rim and all it's wonders. You can do as little or as much as you wish. A trip to be enjoyed by all ages and abilities. Be prepared for the large crowds which flock here all year round especially during the months from spring to late October."

The Rim Trail which is 11 miles long can be taken in sections as desired.Bryce Point is a popular & busy photo shoot.\nFor a more quite, less busy, easy hike, go to the end of the 18 mile park road and take the Bristlecone Loop Trail (1.0 mile). A surprising great short hike was the \"Mossy Cave Trail\" which is on Hwy 12, 5 miles east of the turnoff to the park.\nThe Visitor Center has park personnel to answer questions, a store for postcards, books, etc & flush toilets. The 18 mile Rim Drive has multiple overviews. There is some lodging, campgrounds, a store & restaurant inside the park. There is an excellent paved hiking/bike trail through the park, to Bryce Canyon City and all the way through adjacent Red Canyon.\nBryce Canyon City is a couple of miles outside the park. There are multiple hotels, restaurants, shops, gas stations, etc here."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is an interesting national park. Although there are a number of hiking trails, you can see the \"hoodoo\" rock formations (and a huge natural arch) that are the main attraction by driving through the park to the different scenic overlooks. The park spans 17 miles (there is only one entrance so you have to drive back once you reach the end). This can be done in just a few hours, or you can spend a day or two hiking down into the canyon itself.\nThe hoodoo formations themselves are amazing; massive formations carved by water in an \"amphitheater\" canyon presenting vistas almost as awe-inspiring as the Grand Canyon. This is definitely a park worth visiting that should be seen in person.\nThe entrance fee is a flat $30 per car, which is a bargain for a family, though a little steep as a solo traveler."

     "comment": "Bryce National Park is simply exceptional and a unique place in earth. I do not believe there are rock formations similar to these anywhere on earth.\nThis park is very personal as it is easy to be fully submerged into the park and it’s wonders. The Grand Canyon is great but too big to feel personal. Yosemite can get close to Bryce but more crowded and not quite as easy to touch.\nWe stayed at the lodge which was four cabins in one building. All separate entrances. Rooms were excellent for a National Park. The dining room at the lodge was also superb. Staying there is the difference between a great trip and a good one.\nThe views are less than 100 yards from the rooms and are simply spectacular. Google some of the great pictures of this place. Many trails that easily get you to the floor of the canyon and near the rock formations without too much difficulty. Colors are magnificent and accentuated at sunrise and sunset. You really can see most of what you want to see without needing in park transportation.\nMake sure you see salt and pepper on the way in or out."

The first day we took the free Rainbow Point Bus Tour which goes from the entrance to the far end of the canyon. The views were amazing plus the driver's extensive geological information. I highly recommend it, especially since it's free. The night stars out there are magnificent. We were going to do their Ranger Guided Astronomy Nights program, but the handout they gave us when we entered said it was 3 hours long starting after sunset. The next day I was talking to a ranger and she said she was in charge of the program. When I mentioned we had declined because of the length she apologized and said it's a misprint. The program starts with a short lecture followed by telescope viewing. The attendees can leave anytime they want, next time. If you're planning on going, take a look at all the other close geological state and national parks nearby. You could easily spend 10 days seeing it all beautiful stuff in this area, especially Zion National Park."

     "comment": "Bryce isn't as organized as Zion. The parking lots at the turn-outs were almost comical with how confused people were and the lines of cars waiting to get in. Tour buses everywhere so better to drive the road early morning or late afternoon. That said, of course the scenery is spectacular. However, if you are doing a tour of Southwest Utah...I would just do this in a half a day - or less, as much of what you see here, you will see later on Route 24 or at Capitol Reef, the Grand Staircase or Canyonlands. Honestly, you could to two or three stops inside Bryce and be done. If there are no crowds...go ahead and drive the entire distance...but otherwise, I would ditch it and continue on up to Capitol Reef. We regretted staying two nights here.\nThe real find in this area is Kodachrome State Park about 10 miles away- you get an up close look at some amazing rock formations and can drive on some amazing level but unpaved roads through spectacular, uncrowded scenery. If you camp, you absolutely want to go to Kodachrome.\nThe biggest problem with Bryce is the lack of any low key, attractive/interesting lodging. All there are is about four large commercial hotels and their billboard, flashing signs (the place is in the middle of nowhere..so no, we are not going to miss your honking large hotel!). The choices as to where to stay are limited and Ruby's Best Western clearly has the lion's share of the hotel market here. The plus side is that Ruby's has Everything: a massive restaurant, a huge - and nice gift store, a grocery store, a post office and a few other services. Also, we stayed in the \"main lodge\" and the room was large and very clean. The down side is the commercial feel of the place, the mass of people and the kitschy nature of the place.\nIn the evening, being a captive audience, we went ahead and signed up for the Western singing performance across the street. A bit weird but very entertaining! They have a generic buffet and some country western guys sing on stage. You sit a tables with people you don't know which was fun - so many people from other countries~!\nIf you can avoid staying anywhere near Bryce for the night...you will probably be happier!\n(If you are doing a tour of most of the parks in Southern Utah..it is definitely worth it to get an annual pass for $80 dollars. )"

We wished we had the time to enjoy a meal at the rustic lodge. Make sure you bring plenty of supplies, as there is much less available in the surrounding area than in Zion, for example. If you can conquer your fear of heights, enjoy the mule or horse trail ride amongst the hoodoos."

     "comment": "I have to say that we found Bryce Canyon one of the most amazing places we have ever been. We booked before we left home to do a 3hr horse ride doing the peekaboo loop which we knew went down into the Canyon but never in our wildest dreams we expected it to be like that, I remember sat on my horse at the back of our group just taking in the scenery and I could not believe we where actually riding amongst all those hoodoos! Having not ridden a horse for many years I was a bit nervous at first especially as they tend to walk right on the edge of a sheer drop most of the time but after a while I relaxed and just let it get on with it, we did have a water stop half way round before carrying on back up to the Bryce Canyon Lodge where we started from. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horse riding, and as there were only about 12 in our group you never felt rushed in anyway, the leader kept stopping after so long so we could all catch up and re group. After the ride we went back to Rubys Inn where we where staying and picked the car up and drove through the National Park starting at Bryce Point and working our way back stopping at the various View Points, I must say some got very busy with cars but we were lucky enough to find a space in each of them and Wow the views where just unbelievable . There is a Shuttle Bus that you can catch that will stop at each place if you didn't wish to take the car. I would recommend anyone to visit Bryce."

I don't remember the name, but it include the \"Wall Street\" canyon. It was a moderate walk and very beautiful! We wished we had included this in our vacation plans so we could have stayed and done more exploring. We would HIGHLY recommend Bryce Canyon National Park!!"

What really appealed was the variety of features and the many opportunities for walks of different lengths and difficulties and in different environments. We walked part of a track into the canyon - enough to get a feel of it below the rim - and also the Bristlecone Loop Trail at Rainbow Point. It was certainly worth the extra drive to get there. It is worthwhile to walk between viewpoints and catch a free shuttle back to your car."

     "comment": "We planned this out in detail but nothing could stop reality from happening. We got there mid-day on September 14, 2017 in a thunder storm with hail on the roads and trails. The snowplow was out, strong wind, and sleet hitting our windshield. Determined to see all we could see because this was our afternoon to see Bryce. Our first stop was to be Inspiration Point, we missed the sign and ended up all the way to Swamp Canyon. I didn't know there was a Swamp Canyon, put our rain coats on and took a look. Cold and shivering we returned to our car and went back to find Inspiration Point. Now we saw why we missed the sign which said Sunset Point and Inspiration Point all in one sign and just one turn-off road for both (our map didn't show it that way). We had no problem parking, only one other car in the lot. We went to all the overlooks we could find over there, no hiking like we planned because the trails were covered with 1/2\" thick hail and little rivers running down them. I dropped my camera I was shivering so hard. Then we went to Sunrise Point, we drove in and could not find where we were suppose to go for the scenic lookout. There are many buildings there with names and we finally pulled into a parking lot with the name \"Sunrise Unit\". I asked a man in the parking lot if this was where we should park for the scenic lookout. He said yes but he didn't recommend going there because we could get hit by lightning. I said it's now or never because we may never get back here. I was very surprised walking to the edge of the canyon and got to the edge of this steep cliff with no handrail in sight. Then we went on to Fairyland Point and I thought it was the best of the bunch. We learned you can get great overviews without hiking at Bryce. We also learned that: plan an extra day somewhere on your trip to account for rain. Then we stopped at the visitor's center but that parking lot was full so we couldn't go in there. I am giving Bryce 4 stars because of poor signs and no handrails in some places."

     "comment": "After spending a week in Utah and going to several National parks in the area, Bryce was by far the most amazing site.\nEven if you only have a few hours to spend there, I would definitely recommend going. My group only had about three hours before we had to head to the airport to catch our flight home, but we were able to see the highlights anyway.\nThe Navajo trail will come up as highly recommended whenever you do a search on this park and I can enthusiastically confirm that this absolutely spot on. It is a short, 1.4 mile trail, but it gives you some spectacular views and takes you all the way into the canyon. Even though it is short, the ascent on the way back is rather steep so make sure you have lots of water and take lots of breaks because the elevation can definitely mess with you if you are not used to it. If you have time, you can extend the hike to include the Queen's Garden trail as well, the two combined are extremely popular.\nBefore we set off on the hike, we also took in Inspiration point and, again, this is highly recommended as it gives you a great overview of the entire span of the canyon and you can get some fantastic pictures there.\nThis is a gorgeous park that makes you feel like you are on another planet, I can't wait to come back here again and again."

You can take in the views from the lookout points (there are about a dozen of these along the road through the park) although to really appreciate the landscape, do some of the hikes. The rim trails are relatively easy going and allow you to enjoy the wonderful vistas from the cliff tops. If you are able to take the more strenuous trails down into the bottom of the canyon then you will be amazed. Hoodoos, slot canyons, winding paths, fabulous rock formations and great colours. All just beautiful. We really enjoyed the hikes to and around Queen's Garden, Two Bridges, Tower Bridge and Wall Street. If you're feeling more energetic, the Peek-A-Boo loop trail is absolutely great and takes you to some stunning viewpoints (take lots of water with you and be prepared for some steep ascents and descents on this hike). The park also has a large visitor centre with lots of information, and there are regular ranger led walks. We had a wonderful time."

     "comment": "Stunningly beautiful vistas,exotic hoodoos at the bottom of the canyons, and red/crimson colors that glow at sunrise and sunset make this national park and incredible experience. Bryce is unlike any other park I've seen. The hoodoos and rock formations are so varied and unique. You can drive through the park's 18 mile road, and stop at the 12 or so well marked overlooks. There are also shuttle buses. Most people drive to the end of the canyon and then stop at the overlooks on the way back as then the overlooks are then on the right hand side.\nDon't miss Sunrise and Sunset Points, about 1/2 a mile away from each other at the rim of the main canyon near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Walking along the rim trails provides fabulous photo opportunities.\nOne great hike combines two trails: start at Sunset Point, down 580 feet of S-curves to the Navajo Trail (rated moderate) and puts you at the bottom of the canyon with incredible hoodoos! Seeing them from the bottom of the canyon is a whole different experience, not to be missed. This trail connects to the Queens Garden tail (rated easy) so that you come up at the less steep (approx. 370 feet of climbing) Sunrise Point. The two combined are just over 3 miles and doable in 2 hours give or take, ,depending on your hiking level. You'll walk through a couple of stone doorways that make this hike more unique.\nThere are hikes for every level. Note that elevation may be a factor: Bryce Canyon is at approximately 8,000 plus feet in altitude. It is a spectacular experience and one that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat."

Now, I would rate it as a must-see - not as grand as Yosemite or Grand Canyon, but more stunningly beautiful.\nIt looked great from the rim trail, and even better once we went down into the 'canyon' (really a huge natural amphitheatre). We started at Sunset Point, took the Wall Street trail which linked to the Queen's Garden trail, and were back at Sunrise Point about 2-3 hours later. Actually, I lost track of time, but at no point did I lose the inane grin from my face as I took in one amazing rock formation after another.\nDefinitely a top priority to visit!"

All I can say is lady if you just saw rocks you should reconsider your type of vacations. This place was just as unique as Zion, the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and the other places we visited and we did not walk the trails into the canyon. With envy of the youth of those walking the trails of the canyon we still enjoyed the views and the unique displays of nature in front of us. Oh to be young enough again to fully enjoy this park. You will enjoy it even without venturing on to the trails but if your are in shape enough and young enough allow extra time on your visit to walk the trails!"

We came in from the east and started at the mossy cave hike. A good warmup. The main park has a 18 mile road driving south from the entrance. I recommend driving to the end to rainbow point. For the view. From the sites and trails near the entrance use the shuttle. It is efficient and the parking is restricted at the trailheads and vista lots. The busses run every 10 to 15 minutes. The views are great and the park is well kept."

We drove through the park (paying the $20USD entrance fee) and stopped off at the main viewpoints along the road that runs alongside the canyon pulling off at viewpoints such as Rainbow Point and Inspiration point. When we went in mid April there was still snow on most of the hoodoos which made the view all the more amazing!"

The view points are breathtaking and the hikes are astounding! Everyone should see this enchanting place full of natural structures of spires and pillars in pink, coral, white, orange and rust. There are more hoodoos here then anywhere else in the world. It was humbling to look out over the miles of canyons filled with beautiful structures resembling castles, fortresses, forts columns, spires and walls with arches. It has to be one of the most remarkable places I have ever seen in my life! You simply have to see it to believe it!"

We went into Bryce yesterday morning then again this afternoon. Both times we were once again bowled over by the scenery. Yesterday we couldn't get to Sunset Point or Bryce Point as the parking was full and the Rangers were not allowing anyone else in. But we didn't have that problem today and managed to get to all the view points. As with all the other National Parks we have been to; Bryce is extremely well organised and maintained. The visitor Center was very crowded both times we went in, but they have a good selection of things to buy; useful and interesting information and Rangers on hand to offer advice. We didn't use the shuttle but it seemed to be popular. I didn't use the basic toilets, but there are flushing toilets available at various points! Bryce is great in that even with limited mobility you can get to see so much. And for those more able visitors there are a number of trails. I struggle a bit with the altitude as we live at sea level, but I did manage to do some walking. An excellent park, not to be missed!"

There is also a shuttle bus that appeared to run very frequently.\nWe didn’t use the bus as we generally arrived before sunrise each day."

What we did is we stayed outside and in between these 2 parks so travel time is not too long. Check out cabins in Ordervile."

     "comment": "My wife and I had been planning a trip to the five national parks in southern Utah for several years, and finally we made plans to go. First was Zion, with Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands and then Arches to wind up the trip. Needless to say, the scenery was spectacular, but for us, the best sights were the hudus in the Bryce Amphitheatre. There is nothing short of the chimneys in Turkey that we've seen which compare to the stark elegance and magnificence of the structures and formations we encountered at Bryce Canyon. And even there, the formations at Bryce Canyon have no real comparison.\nThe hikes we took were amazing! My wife, who has breathing problems at higher elevations, took in the hikes as well, and the splendor of the surroundings really energized us both. If I had the opportunity, I'd have gone on every hike available, but the layout of the park allows for easy access to lookouts that afford magnificent views. Of all the parks, I think the lookouts are the best placed for majesty of scenery.\nMy only regret was waiting until my late '60's to go to these parks. And when I do return, Bryce Canyon will be on the top of the list to see yet again."

It is mostly a drive and park adventure with walking views and trails that looked to be for the more experienced hikers. We tried not to miss a stop and so many different rock formations and the terrain was especially different at the higher elevations. These parks all offer comfort stations and if you haven't gone to visit them you are definitely missing out. One thing found in Bryce Canyon that was of interest was the Bristlecone pine tree. This ancient pine tree can be found in Peekaboo Trail, Fairyland Loop and at Rainbow Point. These trees are over 1600 years old. Most views are painted with beautiful rock formations called hoodoos."

You could also take multiple days and do what appear to be some very nice hikes. While we were here it got very cold and we decided not to hike! Please note that if you are a cyclist, there is a great trail called Red Canyon trail that goes into the park a bit, but is mostly north and west out of Bryce Canyon City. A great trail to ride."

I hiked the trail down from Sunrise Point to Queen's Garden, and then back to the top (via a trail that had a short sidetrack to Two Bridges). Boy, coming up from the bottom of the canyon will utilize portions of your lungs that you all but forgot about! It is a difficult hike simply because you are always unslinging your camera to take yet another breathtaking shot.\nWhen I finished, I met up with my wife in the lodge, where we had just an excellent lunch. We each had BLT sandwiches (they put guacamole in them!), mine with homemade potato salad and her's with a garden salad, and both with a pickle spear. Carafe's of ice water were on the tables, and refilled often. $10 each - what a buy.\nWe stayed at the nearby Ruby's RV Campground, which was next to Ruby's General Store (Ruby pretty much owns the town from what we could see). You need to see this general store - we couldn't find a t-shirt we liked at the Bryce Lodge gift shop, but at Ruby's - they had 'em."

We went to Bryce Point, which had fabulous views, and then looked at the trail from there to Inspiration Point, and decided it was just too scary for us, so we took the shuttle there instead. From there we hiked to Sunset Point, went part-way down to the canyon floor, then returned to the rim to hike to Sunrise Point. From there we went to the Lodge for a very nice lunch. If we had more time we would have stayed longer, but we had to drive our niece to Salt Lake City to catch a flight home.\nBryce Canyon is known for fantastic rock formations carved by the wind. They have upright formations know as \"hoodoos\" that are unlike the formations at any of the other parks we visited, so I would definitely recommend a day here. They do have horseback trips, though we didn't try that."

I took a one day tour on 8/28 to Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. It was a small group tour, what was very reasonable, $165.00, and lunch was included. Only the 5 of us were heading out to the parks trough the Virgin River Gorge. The drive was very scenic. First we visited Zion which is a really great park! We made frequent stops for pictures, and had a chance to see some of the animals what are unique to the park. Than our next destination was the breathtaking Bryce Canyon! It is just so beautiful and peaceful! The rock\nformations are awesome! A must see! Our tour guide, Jeff, was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. It was a fantastic day! I most definitely recommend their tour, and I'm planning to take another tour with that company in the future. If you are in Las Vegas, or in the area for whatever reason, take a trip to Bryce Canyon. You will love it!"

     "comment": "There's not much to say about Bryce that hasn't already been said. The park is stunning, however it is a bit more commercialized than some of the other parks (Canyonlands, Arches come to mind). My advice is to get out of the car and do some hiking. The Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden are the most famous for a reason- they are spectacular. I went late afternoon, which was perfect- I enjoyed the drama of the late afternoon sun highlighting the hoodoos and at times had the trails completely to myself. I have a feeling many people try to go early to \"beat the crowds\" but going after 4 I had no problem on the trails (the roadway and overlooks were a bit crowded though).\nBest advice I can give is to go at night. If your timing is right, there is a night sky program run by the rangers that is supposed to be great. I went and unfortunately couldn't find where the program was occurring, but I decided to give it a go myself. It was spectacular. I've never seen the sky look as it did, and I had an overlook completely to myself."

It was stunning and a fabulous example of nature at its best. I think because it doesn't cover such a large area allows you to take in everything much easier. Lots of viewpoints and trail walks allow you to get up close and intimate with the park. Didn't do any of the trails that allow you to descend right into the canyon as my fitness levels wouldn't have allowed it but several of our party who did said it was well worth it. At a price you can always let a mule do the hard work for you as trail rides were on offer. A highly recommended visit."

You've all see the photos and heard all about it, so I will just focus on some tips.\nUse the free shuttle rather than driving yourself around the park. Then you'll have no hassles with parking, and can enjoy looking at the scenery, listening to the commentary, and taking photos. Buses come frequently, so its no problem getting around the park.\nGet info at the visitor center. That way, you can plan how to do the most with your time. There are lots of trails, so they can point out the ones that suit your needs and abilities. Also, fill up with water at the refilling station -- on hot days, you will need it.\nVisit all the observation points. They highlight the key attractions and are close to the shuttle stop points. Easy walking.\nWalk at least one trail. My favourite is going from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point on the Navaho trail route. It goes right into the hoodoos past the Queen's Garden and Thor's Hammer. Gorgeous.\nCome at different times of the day, if you can. The rocks seem to change colors to give a whole new experience."

To fully experience this place a hike is essential, any of the trails I'm sure would offer you a close up experience within the canyon that you will never forget. A top tip is to arrive in plenty of time for the sunset and sunrise view points as these are obviously big hot spots for tourists, and it can be difficult to find a parking space, the shuttle would probably be your best option. I would recommend going to the furthest view point at the start of the day and then work you way back to the amphitheatre to finish with the spectacular sunset."

Even more so than Yellowstone.\nRather than just stop at view points and then move onto the next we had sufficient time for two trail walks. One from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point which is relatively easy and short and the other from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. This was around 2 miles along partly paved tracks and undulated up and down but nothing too strenuous. It can easily be done in an hour or less. The views were stunning from so many points on walk with far reaching views to the horizon and an ever changing array of rock formations in the Canyon.\nDo make time for at least one trail walk and you won't be disappointed."

There is a free shuttle bus that circulates around the park so you don't need a car. There are a number of great hikes that take you down to the bottom of the canyon and back up again, and they are well worth doing. But if you are less adventuresome there is a pretty flat trail that goes all along the rim of the canyon, and you can make that hike/walk as long or short as you like.One fairly short section of it is paved."

     "comment": "While this is an incredibly beautiful place - I was not really prepared for the crowds. Visiting the weekend after labor day - I was surprised by the busloads of visitors crowding the viewpoints.\nWhile the scenic drive is a nice ride on a motorcycle - there are no direct views of the canyon from the road. You have to pull into the vista points - or even better go for a hike to really enjoy.\nThe vista points further out on the road (toward Rainbow Point) are less crowded. They provide great long distance views and scenic overviews. But they do not really show the canyon and hoodoos.\nThe vista points closer to the park entrance (sunset, sunrise, inspiration) provide great views of the Canyon and Hoodoos - but beware of the crowds. Even though I was on a motorcycle, parking at these vista points was difficult. In a car I would have been very frustrated. The number of tour buses is hard to believe.\nNext time, I will probably park at the park entrance and utilize the free shuttle to get access to the trails"

UTAH ROCKS and Bryce Canyon National Park is a must visit.\nWe had 1 day for Bryce and were amazed by hoodoos -\n1) start at inspiration point - has best view of hoodoos, go to the top point and not just the parking lot point\n2) Bryce point - you may check this out but can skip it if you are not doing good on time\n3) Hiking - navajo trail is a must do! Lots of photo ops. Thor's hammer point is a great spot for a picture!\n4) sunset and sunrise - hoodoos glow in the sunlight so defined go their for sunrise but if you are not a morning person then check them out during sunset\n5) stargazing - this park is magical at night. Even on a cloudy day we saw so many stars. Park rangers also put up a presentation at night near visitor centre which one can attend without any prior reservation and is of zero cost. It can get really chilly so recommend to pack a jacket and coffee to enjoy the night sky\n6) wildlife - lots of deers and chipmunks can be spotted around the park. They are adorable.\nParking lot - the one near sunset point is really big so no trouble finding a spot but other lots like inspiration point, Bryce point fill up quickly so plan accordingly."

It's one of those places where pictures cannot do it justice - you have to see it!\nWe parked in Bryce and caught the shuttle bus into the park to Bryce Point, then followed the Rim Trail to Inspiration Point, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point, a route that offered spectacular views of the canyon and amphitheaters beneath.\nFrom Sunset Point, we followed the Navajo Loop Trail down into the canyon which provided equally spectacular views. Being able to explore this part of the canyon, getting up close to rocks and hoodoos formed over millions of years, was a wonderful experience.\nOne day just wasn't enough. I could have easily spent 2 or 3 days exploring the 65+ miles of trails in the park. I can see why people choose to camp and spend their entire holiday inside the park.\nOne ticked off the bucket list...now I really want to return!"

We did a fantastic 2 week self drive trip, starting at Grand Canyon, then onto Monument Valley, then Arches and Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion. We loved the stunning scenery throughout and how each park was so different.\nHiking to the bottom and back up is a great experience. We did Wall Street/Queens Garden loop and the Peek-a-boo trail (down from Bryce Point and up to Sunset Point). Both were superb.\nDriving out to Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Pine trail at 9000 feet is worth it for amazing vistas.\nGetting up early for sunrise is a memorable experience, seeing it light up from the top down.\nStaying up to see the night sky is also a memorable experience."

I'd taken more than 500 photos the previous day of Capitol Reef National Park and the Grand Staircase Escalante National Park, and didn't realize we were only thirty miles from the northern edge of Bryce Canyon Park. I made the comment that I wasn't taking any more photos today.\nWe were barely out of Escalante, when the scenery began to change dramatically. Half an hour later I was shouting that we had to pull over in a turnout so I could take pix of the spectacular scenery. We got out of the car and started a little hike. For the next hour, we continually stopped along Hwy 12 for pix and to climb some of the spectacular formations.\nI never knew what a Hoodoo was until we read about them at the Red Canyon visitor center. Just astonishing natural rock formations.\nYou don't have to pay an entry fee to see the hoodoos and majestic rocky peaks along Hwy 12. The ride is free. At least five (free) hiking/biking trails begin at the Red Canyon visitor center.\nIf you want to turn off on Hwy 63 and enter the main area of the park, admission is free if you own a Senior National Park Pass. Otherwise vehicles are $30, motorcycles are $25, and pedestrians or cyclists are $15.\nThis was our 4th Utah National Park in three days, and I'm pinching myself in disbelief over the stunning beauty of this incredible state."

The rim walk is very nice and easy walk with some great views, and there are Park Ranger presentations at some of the vista points that really adds to the experience as they provide background to the park evolution. There is also a free shuttle running along the rim which is great as it let's you park outside the park and skip the worry about competing for the few parking spots in the park. The hikes are a nice mix of short and long hikes which allow you to experience the park regardless if you have half a day or several days. There were quite large crowds when I visited so a good tip is to start early in the day to beat the crows for the more popular walks. Also worth noting is the temperature which can vary quite a bit due to the elevation, every through an individual day so dress in layers."

We saw Mike deer, elk and problems by the side of the road. We stopped at the visitor center first where the ranger widely advised us to go to the most popular place first, sunset point walking to sunrise. We then zipped to the end of the 16 mile drive, checked it out, and drive back slowly, stopping at every scenic overlook. Each one was Wow, and different from the one before. Our final stop before lunch at the lodge (excellent BLT sandwiches) was Inspiration Point. They saved the best for last! Yes it was crowded and there was barely anywhere to park off season, in the rain, early on a weekday. I would probably take the shuttle in busier times. So glad we went!"

If that's the only thing you have time for, definitely do that. We stopped at all the points beyond there and each offered their own unique panorama. I'd make time for Natural Bridge as well.

There is a complimentary shuttle service that starts outside of the park that you should probably take as parking in the park can be at a premium especially at prime vacation dates. The only problem is you will need transportation to get to many of the \"view sites\" further in the park as there are photo ops along an 18 mile route. My favorites were Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, Natural, and Rainbow point. We were not able to stop at all the points as we got caught in an afternoon thunderstorm. Bryce doesn't disappoint but be sure to walk as with most parks the best sites are best seen on walking trails."

     "comment": "I have lived in the southwest for 3 years and have visited several of the more well known tourist sites, but this was my first visit to Bryce Canyon. There isn't another park in Utah quite like it. The \"hoodoos\" as they are called are beautiful in their own way. Ever changing in different light and weather, you will be amazed by their grandeur. Similar to the red rock you see in Sedona, AZ, but the sandstone on these pillars changes with rain and wind. While it was too warm for us to hike, we enjoyed the 17 mile drive. Best to drive to the very end of the canyon first and make your stops as you head back toward the entry because the canyon is only on one side of the road. Also, everyone seems to stop at the first pull off. It took approx. 3 hours to see the canyon. I will definitely return in cooler climate."

But we had heard some really positive comments about Bryce, some people even finding it more beautiful and interesting than GC. I'm not gonna take part on that debate here, but have to say that Bryce really surprised me with it's beauty. And it's easily manageable...I mean for example Zion can be a total disaster if there is too much tourists. But Bryce is much more easier to handle as you can circle from one viewpoint to another with your own car. You can't do that at Zion and the shuttle service is awful there. There also lot's of different beautiful hike trails in Bryce, some more challenging than the others. Really splendid experience in peaceful and extremely beautiful Bryce."

If you want to avoid them, try the Fairyland area, or Tower Bridge. These are serious hikes, but rewarding. Navajo and Peekaboo are also great, but more traveled.\nA more moderate alternative is to take the shuttle as far as it goes and then walk the rim trail. Relatively easy, and gorgeous."

The shuttle service was very good. Even if you were not too capable of walking around the park, the shuttle service did a real good job in showing the major points of interest. We did the Rainbow Point shuttle tour. Our driver, Jay, was really cool and full of useful information. He pointed out the important points in the park and was engaging when he answered tons of questions.\nThere was a separation of rock from the area of Inspiration point. We were walking along the rim and I was actually able to photograph the slide. It was quite spectacular and the echo in the canyon was impressive. Bryce is a sight to behold and should not be missed. Words cannot describe it, you just have to experience the grandeur and majesty of this wonder."

     "comment": "On this trip we made trek to Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, and to Bryce Canyon. The first two are beautiful but I think Bryce is the most interesting. The Hoodoos, the canyons and the natural bridge pictured above are outstanding. If you still use 35mm film, take several rolls, you'll need them. If you shoot with digital make sure you have an empty chip or at least one that can store several hundred pictures. Again you'll need it.\nThe park has a shuttle service that can and will take you to almost every overlook. We drove but if you want to sit back and relax between picture opportunities the shuttle is the way to go. The shuttle is free but you will have to pay the National Park fee to enter.\nI would suggest you get the National Park pass or the lifetime Senior pass. Either one is $80 but in two or three trips they will pay for themselves. Entry into Yellowstone, Grand Tetons and Bryce Canyon would have paid for the pass."

Thank goodness for digital cameras, because we would have blown through about 20 rolls of film in the old days. You cannot take a step without seeing another amazing view/tree/rock/hoo-doo/formation, etc. The Queen's Garden trail down from Sunrise Point is super easy on the way down and going up, Wall Street is really steep, but with all the switchbacks, it's not at all hard. There is a nice little store for getting snacks and water and the Visitor's Center is very nice and informative. This park is amazing and I cannot wait to go back."

     "comment": "This National Park was our first stop in our Summer Vacation in Utah. My wife and I had visited some 20 years ago and it's just as beautiful as we remember.\nSince this is a well reviewed attraction on TA, here's some logistical items instead:\n1. If you're here during summer, bring lots of water and snacks. It can get quite warm and the hiking and elevation will drain you pretty quickly.\n2. Additionally, summer brings afternoon thunderstorms and rain.Nothing terrible but just be aware of the lightning. You don't want to be standing on the rim trail out in the open with lightning coming down around you.\n3. If you're going to do any of the hikes, such as the Rim Trail, keep in mind the altitude. You'll be up around 8,000 to 9,000 feet.\n4. Pictures. Definitely bring a camera. The views here are spectacular and make for some amazing photos. If your camera or mobile device as the ability to do panoramic photos, you can find some awesome spots to get huge sweeping vistas.\n5. Speaking of photos ... the canyon edges are dangerous and are usually covered with loose rock and dirt. Be careful. It's a long drop to the bottom.\n6. Parking can be a challenge. It's very limited inside the park Get here early or plan on driving around a lot to find a space.\n7. Finally, I would strongly recommend that you park where ever you can and then walk. This is one of those places that's best viewed up close and personal.\nThis is definitely one of the National Parks you have to stop and see. if you plan on doing at least four National Parks in the area, get an annual pass. It'll pay for itself at the fourth and it'll save a bit of time as well. They'll give you this little holder for the card that attaches to your rear-view mirror so you can just leave it hanging and then visit any National Park in the area."

We combined the Navajo Trail with the Queen's Garden Trail and don't be fooled: yes, maybe this is the easiest hiking trail in Bryce Canyon, but it is still challenging and steep enough. But it's so beautiful! When we were at the bottom of the canyon, it even began to snow - what a unique experience. I'd love to come back one time."

     "comment": "Nothing to say here that hasn't already been said about Bryce's stunning natural beauty. So just let me add a couple of personal observations and suggestions. (1) Absolutely, if you're physically able, take a hike into the canyon floor. Queen's Garden is the easiest, not all that demanding, but the views from the floor area are spectacular. Adding on the partial Navajo through Wall Street adds to the effort but is so, so worth it. (2) Unless you're a committed backpacker, two days at Bryce is probably plenty. (3) If you're coming to Bryce in the summer from either Zion or Moab, you'll appreciate the heat break; Bryce is around 8000' altitude at the amphitheater, over 9000\" at Rainbow, and considerably cooler than those others. A light jacket for morning hikes is a good idea."

We trekked downwards from the sunrise point. The following day we also did the Mossy trail , the approach for which is outside the park and is about 5 to 6 kms away from the park entrance.\nThe trek till the bottom was fine and comfortable although temperatures being high, do remember to carry lots of water. The trek up was very difficult and tiring. Came across some squirrels ( known as chipmunks in US) who were aggressive and not afraid of humans. While moving up the canyon we came across very narrow stretches which makes the climb even more difficult. Most of the structures were very awkward looking . At times it looked like a row of people sitting in straight lines."

     "comment": "So obviously Bryce is amazing and completely worth going to see. So are the rest of our National Parks but Bryce is the second most overcrowded NP I've ever been to (second to Zion). Bryce was the first NP where we have ever felt like you were almost forced into taking a bus throughout it. Yes the bus was convenient but the overlooks were slammed and most of the crowds never even looked at the scenery. They waddled off the bus, turned their backs to the amazing vistas and took selfies making sure the background was there. Such a different vibe than Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the like.\nAnyhow, Bryce is worth going but if there is ANY way you can go some other time than the summer you will have an exponentially more enjoyable experience."

We drove out to the \"end\" and worked our way back... which took some time... but the best was at the end.\nAlso, try to be there at sunset to see the colors change.\nGet the annual pass to ALL the national parks!"

     "comment": "If we had to pick a #1 destination from our 3 week trip out west Bryce Canyon would be it! Incredible does not even begin to describe this place BUT to really enjoy it you have to walk down among the hoodoos and other formations and look up. You won't see the best of it just from the rim. BE PREPARED for some steep climbs though!\nHeading out of a morning, thankfully with water bottles, snacks and sturdy shoes but sadly no hiking sticks, we had full intention of just stopping at each point via shuttle, going home for lunch and taking the Queen's Garden Trail later in the day. (Hah!) SO with that in mind we got on the FREE shuttle outside our campground (Ruby's Inn) and took it to the farthest point that the shuttle goes - Bryce Point. Wow! What an introduction!\nTwo of our children decided they wanted to hike down the trail. Good idea? Did we fall for it? Oh yes! Always ready for an adventure off we set. Although the night had been cool the day was warming up quite nicely! The trail that the kids wanted to hike was called the Peekaboo Trail but to get to the start of it you have to walk over a mile down and up switchbacks. (Altogether 5 1/2 miles.) As we walked down we were already dreading having to walk back up.\nOnce on the Peekaboo we took the left fork as a bathroom was needed. Yes, thankfully, there is one down there available during the summer months! It was only on our return that we read that a \"Clockwise Direction Required\" was actually written on the official Bryce Canyon paper! (Good job we went the right way! The Wall of Windows is amazing as are many of the different shapes and sizes of hoodoos.\nAt the bottom, at the halfway point of the Peekaboo Trail we stopped for a snack and then made the executive decision we were going to take the adjoining path and get onto the Navajo Loop Trail. There at the bottom was a guide and so we asked him which side was the best to take. He advised us that the left hand side was way more iconic and so off we went. Oh my! What sights we saw and would have missed, including Wall Street, had we not gone this way. It is only 3/4 mile but this one really makes you climb! Thor's Hammer can be seen once you reach the top.\nIf this is your first visit to Bryce Canyon, like it was ours, we would advise you to visit the Visitor's Center first where you can educate yourself on the canyon, watch the movie etc."

We were happy to see drinking fountains with water bottle faucets and you should fill up water while here as there is none available on the hike. Our first glimpse of the ampitheater left us amazed at the natural beauty of the park. The Navajo Loop was very steep but at the bottom it leveled off. The Queens Garden trail was just as scenic. The visitor center was crowded but had some nice exhibits."

I've been to the Grand Canyon twice and thought I knew what to expect but the natural wonder that Bryce Canyon is goes beyond exhilarating. The colors and formations are phenomenal and I would not recommend leaving Southern Utah without seeing this spectacular wonder of nature."

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is a 3-4 hr drive from Las Vegas but a very worthwhile trip, either just for the day or as a longer side trip. Parking is tight but there is always someone pulling out, so just be patient.\nFor day trippers, you can easily spend anywhere from 1-3 hours just soaking in the beauty and walking along the rim. For the more adventurous there are many hikes into and around the amphitheater. If you're lucky you may spot some elk and other wildlife.\nIt is a long day from Vegas but if you combine it with Zion Canyon you can have an amazing experience in a day trip."

Do not miss Wall Street and the Queen's Garden trails. Also, seeing the sunrise and sunset are real treats. Go to Bryce Point for sunset. Bryce is one of the only places in the US considered a dark sky location without light pollution. You have to stay and see the Milky Way when it gets dark. You can also use the Sky app to identify the stars and constellations. Overall, Bryce was one our our favorite national parks and should not be missed."

I also recommend doing the horse back riding down into the canyon. One of our absolute highlights. We stayed about 20 minutes away at this fantastic Motel called Bryce Pioneer Village Motel in Tropic. It has a restaurant, pool, jacuzzi and volleyball on site.

     "comment": "Okay. Everybody has heard of Bryce Canyon. And that is part of the problem. There were tourists everywhere and I mean everywhere. Even though we got there at like 6:30 in the morning nearly all the parking spots were already taken. Another thing that's important to know if you are going to go, you need to go at sunset. At Sunrise, the sun is in the canyon and so you can't really take pictures. Even though they have a \"sunrise view,\" that means you can look at the Sunrise, not take pictures AT sunrise. There is no way to take pictures without the sun being in your camera unless you go towards Sunset. It was our mistake, we did not know that. We probably would have been better off going the day before, way later in the day. But There were so many people it was not that enjoyable. Selfie sticks, screaming kids, etc There weren't as many animals, no wildflowers, and the like. Cedar Breaks was such a delight and so if you want Canyon views but also want wildflowers, to have a place pretty much to yourself, have deer Antelope Chipmunks ground squirrels and the like, I honestly would say go to Cedar Breaks and Skip Bryce. But if you need to check it off your list, then at least go later in the day so that your photos won't be washed out."

     "comment": "A must see National Park. Busier than the Grand Canyon North Rim, but not over crowded in mid to late August. Not many easy hikes other than the rim walks that give you amazing views for over 30 miles. It was fun to sit in the sun and be cooled by the cool wind blowing out of the canyon. The Navajo Loop was our hike of choice as it allows you to hike in and around the hoodoos, through a few small archways, under 1.5 miles and we had some tires little legs with us. Though many do this hike it is not an easy hike lots of elevation change walking next to drop offs and hiking in loose footing. Bryce Canyon Point Natural Bridge and Rainbow Point are all worth the drive to see. The day we went the rangers had a telescope for us to look at the sun through... we were skeptical to say the least. They had a filter that allowed you to do this without burning your eyes out. Unique opportunity to see the sun, it appeared red and you could see sun flares. Nice visitor center at the entrance of the park to get your National Park Passport stamped and learn a few facts about Bryce. Our only regret is getting ice cream inside the park instead of waiting to get it at one of the shops outside the park."

The hoodoos are truly awe-inspiring, crafted by the elements of weather.\nThere is a shuttle bus going around the area. If you don't have your own ride going out of the park, be mindful of the last trip.\nThere are different loop trails to choose from. We took the NAVAJO LOOP TRAIL which is an easy to moderate hike.\nIf you have a senior citizen with you, that's an extra blessing. They will give you a discount :) Just make sure they have their ID's with them or their Pass, just in case. We only paid $10 for entrance fee.\nWhat to bring:\n1. Bottled Water - Note: there is a refilling station in the areas like the Navajo Loop;\n2. Camera - Totally a haven for taking landscape photos and selfies. Extra battery pack. You will definitely regret it when you run out of juice.\n3. Hat or Umbrella - It drizzles when we went there.\n4. Walking stick - it would help because there are some not so steep areas but definitely will help you balance\n5. Bring snacks - we had \"spamusubi\" and energy bars.\nWhat to wear:\nWalking shoes, light and comfortable clothing. Remember to put on a lot of sunscreen.\nBest time to take photos - Sunrise and sunset when the hoodoos are orange red in color.\nNote:\n****Please be careful not to bump someone's TRIPOD :)\n****It is best stop by the Visitor's Center first to watch the video on how the Canyon was formed. That way, you will appreciate the place more.\n****And there is a designated place to park your vehicles.\nHappy hiking!!!"

Only complaint was that part of the park was closed due to road maintenance in JUNE (which the rangers would not say why, but found out later on the website)?! Luckily everyone in the group was a bit tired of hiking and it ended up being a good rest day. We started at Bryce Point, then to Inspiration Point. From there my son and I walked to Sunrise and Sunset Point and my daughter wife and mother-in-law picked us up at sunset point. The views were spectacular. All encompassing whichever way you looked. We also hiked down a little (without my mother-in-law) down the Queens Garden Trail. Kids were tired and hot, so we turned around about 75% of the way down. The walk-up was pretty tough for the kids and my wife with it being so hot out. We all made it though with lots of water breaks. So glad we all had camelbacks!"

The view from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point is one of the most beautiful creations, almost on the magnitude of the Grand Canyon. Photos just cannot do justice to what your eyes will see. There are many other observation points in the park. Take the time to visit each one. We did not hike the garden, but I am sure it is outstanding up close. This park is a hidden gem and certainly one of the best in Utah, and one should take the time to visit. The Scenic Byway from Bryce NP to Moab is likewise a must drive if you enjoy God's creation. It is breath taking."

Overlooks start as soon as you enter the park and continue as long as you choose to investigate as far as 20-miles into the park. Camping is available with reservations. Hiking provides spectacular views, but does take time and has steep grades.

     "comment": "My family and I recently visited Bryce Canyon National Park. The visit almost ruined the beautiful experience due to one Ranger's comment. When we pulled up to the Ranger station to enter the park, my father asked if there were any discounts (such as as senior discount because our grandma was with us, or a veteran's discount since I served in the U.S. Navy) and the Ranger promptly stated \"Yes, but they are for U.S. Citizens only.\" None of us gave any thought to the comment until after my father paid to enter. It wasn't until we drove away, that we realized what she had said. She assumed that a car full of Filipino Americans were not U.S. Citizens based on the color of our skin. My siblings and I were all born in this country, I have SERVED this country, and we love this country for all that it has given us. So much so that we give back as much as we can! This is the first time I have ever decided to leave a negative comment on any place we've visited due to the service we were given. I know that this one Ranger's comment does not reflect the thoughts of the people who work at the National Park, however I just wanted this experience to be shared so that it may resonate with those who have ever wanted to assume someone's nationality before asking any questions. I love our National Parks for their beauty, wonder, and it's reminder that we are all just a small speck in this beautiful world. I will come back again to Bryce Canyon time and time again. I just hope that people will learn to respect other's when we come together to share in the wonders of Earth's beauty."

     "comment": "This was our 7th National Park this year and everyone deserves 5 Stars. This park is no exception. I love Bryce Canyon because of the awe factor. When you get out of your car and see it for the first time it's very dramatic. It's a gorgeous park. This was my third time here. However, the last time was 30 years ago. It is about 3x as crowded and I see now that they run shuttle busses. If we were planning on staying the whole day we would have done that. We got there late afternoon so parking wasn't to much of a hassle. It was still busy and crowded but not as bad as I was expecting after being in Yellowstone. The visitors center is worth the stop and a great gift shop."

One particular driver stood out, April Lefevre, was awesome. Her 3.5 hour Rainbow Tour was beyond delight. May I add this tour was FREE, cannot get any better value than that. April's warm hospitality and style was out of this world. Her knowledge of Bryce was so deep and interesting, her style really captured my kids attention and curiosity. My daughter in particular enjoyed her very much. April shared so many wonderful stories, facts, and jokes really made our visit to Bryce so memorable. Thank you April and the entire staff at Bryce for being so hospitable."

We were limited on time so we opt to take the horseback ride to the bottom of the canyon. It was an exciting and memorable experience and will be remembered for many years. The only complaint we had was being there in July, during Bryce's monsoon season. The clouds rolled in so fast, before we know it, we were drenched by three thunderstorms. It got chilly and we were not prepared for that. Luckily there wasn't lightning. We only spent a few hours here and wished we had more time to explore this beautiful park. Until next time!"

     "comment": "My wife and I first visited and camped at Bryce Canyon in 1989. This was our first trip back and we brought our 17 year old daughter, 21 year old son, and his fiance. We all had a wonderful time. There were a few serious storms and downpours but they only added to the beauty, wonder, and positive experience. The park is big enough and the storms isolated enough that a dry trail was easy to find.\nI have to give high praise to the park staff. They were fun, well-informed, enthusiastic and helpful. Seriously, we were all so impressed.\nLike other National Parks suffering from over-crowding there is a shuttle bus system in the park. Our visit was crowded but we were able to find parking spots with little or no wait.\nWe drove out to the very end of the park to Rainbow Point and hiked a short loop trail that offered stunning vistas.\nMossy Cave: This is an easy hike with mild elevation gain and NOT in the main park area. Go past the road to the main gate on Rt 12 and down below the canyon. On the right side of the road is a pull out for the trail head and toilets. BE ADVISED: there is no water station here so bring your own.\nQueens Garden/Navajo Trail/Rim Trail Sunset Point to Sunrise Point: LOVED this hike. RAther than go down the side of Navajo Loop that has Thor's hammer, which you will see at the start of the hike at Sunset Point stay to the right and go down into the canyon through an amazing slot canyon that has some massive pines somehow growing up through the canyon. At the bottom join the Queen's Garden Trail and take that to Sunrise point. The assent is a bit strenuous but just take a break and enjoy the view every now and again. You will enjoy the canyon and the accomplishment.\nNotable sights: Inspiration Point and Fairyland Point. Also stop in the visitor center and check out the ranger talk schedules."

That way you don't have to hike uphill. I did the Navajo and Peekaboo Trail which were amazing. Navajo Trail is a must trail here, I would recommend that when going down the trail going left will make it easier to hike back up. The Peekaboo trail I would recommend that you go right where the \"v/trail\" starts and make it to at least the Wall of Windows. Watch out for horse dropping on Peekaboo/and the smell can be bad at times."

We did go down into the canyon for a 4 mile hike from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point during the daytime. Wall Street was jam packed with tourists. It actually looked like a human ant farm. Once we got past Wall Street though the crowds thinned out. The hike down into the canyon was quite easy and absolutely breath taking. However, what goes down must come up and coming up wasn't a piece of cake. It was REALLY hot and while the incline wasn't bad, it was a hard hike up (especially for my 12 year old son). We all had camelbacks, which is a 'must' in the heat! You can not overestimate how much water you need. Bring more than you think you'll need.\nWe really liked our hike (except for maybe my son) and we loved the views of the canyon at sunset. We also really enjoyed seeing several deer within the park."

The afternoon we arrived we hiked the Rim Trail trail from Bryce point to Sunset. This is an easy hike that allowed excellent views. We took our time and made it a leisurely hike and stopping frequently to enjoy the impressive rock formations.\nWe returned the following day and hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden Trail. I recommend it highly. My two teenagers were awed by the beauty. Hiking amongst the hoodoos versus seeing them from the rim is a must and worth the effort. We each took dozens of photos.\nThe trail is busy but wasn't crowded. Besides we spent so much time taking in the scenery that it never was an issue.\nWhat surprised me most was the lack of rangers. My wife and I commented that we thought we would see more.\nBryce is such a great National Park. I highly recommend it. Wish we had more time to explore."

We saw people in wheelchairs and with walkers at the canyon rim.\nWe did the Queens Garden/ Navajo Trail hike (liked Wall Street so much that we returned and did the Navajo Trail a second time), the Rim Trail from Bryce point to the lodge, Bristlecone Loop (takes you out to Yovimpa Point which is amazing) and the Mossy Cave Trail. The were all very easy except Queens Garden/Navajo Trail which has some wicked switchbacks. I really loved the area. The views are beautiful and change with the sun/clouds. We did not stay in the park, but rented a charming farmhouse in Tropic. I would love to see the area in the winter (with snow) as I'm sure it would be completely different, but wonderful!"

Park at National Park Shuttle Stop just outside the park; pay the entry fee, and then take the shuttle into the park and the Visitor's Center. Watch the movie and see the exhibits and then hop the shuttle again to go to the observation points. You can drive your car but parking is limited and traffic is crazy. Easy to do the park in one day."

     "comment": "Absolutely stunning. This is a park that is a feast visually. Easy to drive from overlook to overlook. Most of the path on the rim trail is paved. Lots of parking and facilities (restrooms, picnic tables, water bottle refill stations). We drove up from Zion as a day trip.\nI would have loved to hike here and we had time. However, you're another 2,000-2,500 feet higher than at Zion and yes - the air is thinner. During our road trip we had snacks in the car that we purchased in Zion - pop chips to be exact. So the bag expanded so much that it was taut and we thought it would indeed burst and pop chips all over the car. So yeah - if you're not used to that altitude, it may take some time to get used it before you embark on a hike across desert at the bottom of a hot hoodoo canyon. That's my only regret - no hiking to the bottom and across, and I hear that it's splendid.\nTake your refillable water bottle with you and a heavier coat. It was warm in Zion, but windy and cold up in Bryce (altitude change)."

Did not take the shuttle but seems a good way to do the main Amphitheater. The scenic drive is definitely worth it esp to Rainbow point. The highlight for our family was the horseback ride through the canyon. Really a great way to get up close to the hoodoos. The highlight for my 11 and 14 yo. Definitely do the Navajo Loop. The rim hike is a good one too for great views-we did some of it in the evening just before sunset. Beautiful!!"

What goes down, must come up. :0) We are in our middle 70s and have done a lot of beautiful hikes during our 12 years of RVing. This hike definitely looked more challenging (from the top). The well maintained trail, with lots of hairpin turns (helped with the steepness) made it easier than I thought. How does one describe what it is like, walking among slot canyons, arches and a bazillion amazing natural formations. Each one with it's only personality, allowing one to use their imagination. It is impossible to take a bad photo. I would allow at least 3 hours, use good walking shoes, walking stick and stay hydrated. Am having a hard time picking out just a few photos as we took lots. If you have time, I highly recommend doing the hike down. Pick up a map at the Visitor Center and they can tell you the length of the various trails. God outdid Himself on this one."

Take the shuttle all the way to Bryce point and get off of the bus for pictures. Get back on the bus and take it to Inspiration point. Get off the bus Inspiration point and walk all the way to sunrise point. This path is paved for most of the walk. From sunrise point, take the Navajo Trail – at one point it forks, and we opted for we opted for Wall Street because of the amazing views and photo opportunities. The Navajo Trail eventually joins with the Queen's garden loop. And the Queens Garden loop eventually hits sunrise point. This was an aggressive hike for us, especially our eight-year-old. But I would do it again in a heartbeat. we then took the shuttle to the gift shop and we got our \"I hiked the hoodoo\" sticker. This entire trip was 8am until noon. We were tired but were so happy we got an early start!"

     "comment": "Bryce Canyon is well worth a visit but to me it is rather limited in it's appeal. Sure the main hoodoo ampitheatre here is unique and rather special, but away from there, the canyon is very nice but nothing to write home about. It lacks the kind of vistas that Canyonlands have (they have great hoodoos too) and it lacks the photogenic grandeur of Zion or Yosemite. We were rather underwhelmed to be honest.\nThe walk down into the canyon to the Queen's garden area is a great experience but it is quirky rather than awe inspiring. I am sure walks away from the main hoodoo area also have much of interest but if you are on a limited time trip there are several other places where more time can be better spent."

It was such a long drive, so after checking into the hotel we drove part of the canyon for sunset photos and to scope out the trails for the next morning. We enjoyed all our time there. If you do not want to hike down in the canyon, the rim trails are excellent. I like driving so after hiking, we drove to the far end and made our stops on the way back. This is a place where I will definitely return. They do have shuttles so if that works out best for you go ahead."

     "comment": "This park blows your mind with all those exotic hoodoos! The hikes are excellent and at every turn you see sights that leave you speechless. You just marvel at nature's excellent design sense and creativity. The park has a good shuttle system and if visiting during peak season and peak hours, taking the shuttle is a great option to save you from the hassles of parking. Parking at each trail head and point is easier to find later afternoon or early morning. We did half the Peekaboo trail (2.7 miles) and combined it with the Navajo loop (0.6 miles. the other half was closed) thanks to a ranger's suggestion and it was awesome! We also walked from sunset point to inspiration point which is a great trail with fantastic views.We caught sunset at inspiration point (gorgeous) and stayed past midnight for the stars! Oooooh so pretty! The next morning we drove straight to Rainbow point (the end of the road) thanks to some great tips online and worked our way backwards to all the vista points. We did a 1 mile RT Bristlecone trail loop at Rainbow point and stopped at Black Birch Canyon, Ponderosa Canyon, Agua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point, Swamp canyon, Sunrise Point. We then hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail (1.8 mile RT) which was beautiful! On our way out of Bryce, we stopped at the Mossy Cave trail (0.8 mile RT). All in all, this park is something else! My dreams were full of hoodoos for several days!\nNote: There are water filling stations at the visitor center so carry your refillable bottles and use them instead of buying several small plastic bottles thereby reducing plastic waste."

A visit to the Visitor Center is always recommended.\nUnlike Zion, BC allows for vehicular access to many stops though most \"vistas\" or \"overlooks\" require a bit of an uphill hike to truly appreciate. BC offers many wonders to behold and worth more than the 4 to 5 hours our itinerary allowed.\nDuring the season BC offers NPS sponsored talks dealing with many areas of interest to the inquiring mind. We happened by chance upon a talk by a park volunteer delivered with the Canyon as a backdrop. To listen to him explain the geologic process's that formed the landscape we beheld made me wish I had paid closer attention in Geology class. Young kids were in attendance, even they were listening. good Q & A afterward as well. If we do this again I will check the BC website where talks and events are posted so as to better plan the trip.\nIf you want to see wildlife go to another park. There were several huge crows/ravens hanging out near the parking areas waiting for handouts but that was the extent of the critters we saw.\nUpon our departure from BC we were faced with one of those choices any married couple faces many times along the road to, thus far, 35 years of marital bliss. Do I (she asks) trust the GPS taking us on the direct route to Torrey, N on US-89, or do I say yes once again, to him, and trust all will be well by taking the long way along the \"All-American Road\"; the \"Scenic Byway\", Utah SR 12?\nNext time....the Scenic Byway and a drive not to be missed......"

I don't know where else you can see them. The way the color changes during the day as the sun is bright, or when it sets makes it a different look throughout the day.

Get your butt out of bed and see the daylight come into the amphitheater.. We stayed at the Best Western Ruby's complex, short drive to Inspiration Point, Sunrise point, sunset point, you can't pick a bad spot for sunrise. Do not count on the bus getting you into the park for sunrise, it does not start soon enough. Saw people standing at the bus stops early in the morning and it was going to be a couple hour wait for them. Drive all the way into the park to see the all the lookouts. Don't stop until you get to Rainbow point, 18 miles into the park. Then do all the pullouts on the way back out, so you are not crossing traffic. Now, plan on a day of hikes down into the hoodoos, Navajo and Queens garden are fairly easy and get you down with the hoodoos. Or, do the 3 hour fantastic horseback ride which takes you on a full tour of the canyon. The ride on peek a boo loop was one of the most beautiful rides I have been on. Don't do a ride outside the canyon, book with Canyon Trail rides to take you actually into the main amphitheater. We had Trent as our trail leader and he was terrific. Trust your horse and hang on. The horses/mules were in great shape and well cared for."

The bus is air conditioned. Our guide was April. She had grown up in the area and is currently a cattle rancher in a nearby ranch. Her local knowledge was fantastic. She added her own stories and personality to make the tour feel more like a field trip! It takes 3.5 hours and you make about 4 or 5 stops. Each stop is only a short distance to the viewpoint and several have rest rooms. This was the best way to see Bryce. We all learned so much and had a wonderful trip."

Still scenery was very nice and the hoodoos were the stars of the show. Lodge and cabins available for rent to visitors. Cannot comment on quality as we did not stay here. Also a park store where visitors can buy souvenirs, etc. Store was very hot, apparently no a/c. Other activities in the park include hiking and horse riding. (Again cannot comment on quality of these activities). Bryce Canyon City is located near Bryce Canyon. Motels, food, etc. are available and is very convenient to the Park. Several miles from the main park is a bike trail right near the road. Also stop at the forestry headquarters near the turnoff from the main highway. There is a statue of Smokey the Bear. Good for photos with kids of all ages. (I had to get one of myself and my wife with Smokey.) Plenty to do here. You can see the whole park in one day, but would not get to enjoy all of the park activities."

The views and rock formations are amazing. My favourite was Wall Street. This National Park should be on everyone's bucket list as it is a truly spectacular place to visit."

     "comment": "A visit even better than the first. We allowed more time to spend on the hikes that go below the rim. We also hikes on the easy bristlecone trail on the south end of the park which we thought had the most amazing views of the park. We also did the east Mosey Cave hike which was worth the extra effort of locating the trailhead outside of the park.\nWe also found it was more enjoyable to start the visit in the late afternoon, stay for sunset, stay overnight in Bryce, and then continue in the park early the next morning."

The approximately five kilometres walk into the valley, and then out on to the rim was physically moderate but well worth every minute.\nBe sure to take plenty of water and wear sunscreen during summer."

     "comment": "Spectacular views of sandstone made red cliffs and hoodoos.\nWe did one day trip to Bryce from Zion. That time was enough to see all vista points and did Navajo loop trail.\nMy favorite view was Bryce point and inspiration point.\nTip: since all views are on the left side, start from the last vista point and then visit in reverse direction so don't need to cross road all the time."
