The views are beyond amazing, bring a camera but don't forgot to just soak up the experience. As other reviews mentioned, check out both the upper and lower falls if you have time but be prepared for steep paved trails to the lower falls. Explore some of the other dirt trails too if you can. Definitely a must do if you are in Yellowstone."

Take the paths and take the hikes if you can at all. If time is a factor, the north rim is the best, in my opinion. It is a 2-3 hour experience once there to do all parts. Remember, from any entrance to the park, there is considerable driving to get to any attraction. The time herein is the time at the attraction, not the time to get there"

     "comment": "I was struck by just how the geology here creates some of the most interesting scenery in Yellowstone NP. From the falls to the hoo doos there is so much color here.\nOur experience began on the north side of the canyon where there are fewer visitors. A switchback trail takes one down around 600 feet to catch a view of the falls. You do need to remember though that, at 8000ft in elevation, the climb back up should be done slowly to respect the lower oxygen levels (unless, of course, you're acclimatized to these altitudes).\nWhile the number of visitors on this side of the canyon are fewer I'd still recommend getting here early in the day if for no other reason than to catch the morning light on the water. During our visit the skies were starting to fill up with the haze from the forest fires in Oregon and California which created an almost otherworldly color palette to photograph."

Some of the hikes down are steep so be prepared. The views are breath taking. We spent the entire day going around the rim. Unfortunately Uncle Tom’s staircase was closed. Go earlier during the day as it’s less crowded and gets hotter as the day goes on"

     "comment": "We did both the North and South Rim on Friday 9/4. Both areas have easy to access scenic overlooks with great views and very little walking. You can easily see waterfalls. The only exception is the Brink of the Lower Falls - this is a steep descent of 600 feet in 3/8 of a mi and you need to also climb back up. The Brink took us 25 min to walk up and down. All the other spots on the North and South Rim were easy to do and we spent anywhere from 10 - 15 minutes at each spot.\nThe North Rim was nice and quiet in the morning at around 8 am. We spent around 1 hr and 15 minutes there.\nFor the South Rim, we spent around 45 minutes total time there with 10 - 15 minutes each at Artist Point and Uncle Tom's Point."

     "comment": "In my opinion, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is the most beautiful place in the park. It expresses the park's complex geologic history in dramatic colors and shapes. Puffs of steam mark hydrothermal features in the canyon's walls. The Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River add to the grandeur of the unique natural treasure.\nWe viewed it from the North and South Rim and from lookout, inspiration and artists points. Unfortunately the brink was closed during our visit but I would have loved to get a workout and get that close to the falls.\nWe went about 8:30 am to beat the crowds and spent about 2 hours there. Make sure you take a lot of pictures and videos but it does not do it justice when you come home and look at them. Enjoy."

The large rock walls with the central waterfall and flowing river may be frightening, but are truly a work of nature. The falls flow extremely fast and heavy, and it is amazing to see the sheer power of it. Hikes can be a bit challenging because of the contest zig zag pattern that is very steep on the way back up. For one of the best views, I recommend going to the lower falls viewpoint. The hike is about .5 miles, but is a bit challenging. I highly recommend this!"

The entire park is one amazing geological feature after another and full of wildlife. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was breathtaking; surely as beautiful as the South or North Rims of \"the\" Grand Canyon.

The trail towards the falls offers great views but is not for unwatched small children as the dropoffs are deadly. Recommended. The hike away from the falls offers equally spectacular views and a paved, much safer and easier hike. The day we got there we listened to a park ranger talking about the falls and then he hung around to answer questions. Spectacular place to take pictures of the entire falls."

Standing here, it feels like you’re in an actual drawing! There are several ways to access and view the Grand Canyon of YellowStone. If you look through the online tour, it will help you pin point which ones you want to visit.\n-Brink of Lower Falls trail is HIGHLY RECOMMMENDED!!! It’s .4 mile down and back up so it is a little strenuous but takes you to the very top of the waterfall. The view from here is absolutely incredible!!! Not only are you right at the rush water of top of the fall, but the view down the canyon is breaktaking.\n-Another good trail is Red Rock Point which is just as strenuous down, .3 miles, and back up but it takes you to the lower part of the falls.\n-Inspiration Point and Artist Point are both near parking and short walks to the overlook with some of the best views. Uncle Tom’s trail takes you into the canyon for great views. It was unfortunately closed when we visited the park.\n-Many places along the canyon has parking for you to drive around, park and visit. Parking areas are designated in the image to the left."

The road to Lamar Valley had just closed due to weather, so we drove to the canyon and had a great time BY OURSELVES! Parking is somewhat limited if you are a summer traveler. Dad can’t walk long distances so paths were very helpful. Vistas amazing. Words can’t describe what a great (chilly) experience we had with the sight all to ourselves. You won’t get this experience in the summer! Our trip was a few days before much of the park closed for the winter. I’ve seen this view in years past, but we loved seeing it in some winter glory. Take photos!!"

     "comment": "#1 Rule: Don't forget your camera, make sure your batteries are charged and that you have plenty of SD cards for your digital camera.\nWhat is here: The dramatic, 1,000-foot-deep Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone rewards visitors with dazzling views of multi-hued rock walls and majestic waterfalls. With walking and hiking trails for all abilities, and learning opportunities for the whole family, it’s easy to spend an entire day in this unique area of the park.\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is roughly 20 miles long and varies from 1,500 to 4,000 feet wide. Geologists believe it was formed as the Yellowstone River eroded softer, less resistant rock that had been weakened by hydrothermal gases and hot water.\nThe colorful canyon is a natural work of art: streaks of red, orange, gold, black, and even green decorate the canyon walls. Several miles of trails connect 10 primary overlooks that afford dramatic views from both sides of the canyon.\nWhen we went there had been snowfall and it made the most beautiful pictures since it was combined with all of the colors of the canyon.\nWhether it’s your first visit to Yellowstone, or you visit regularly, everyone loves a summer day in the park. Here’s how to get the most out of yours.\nThe best way to experience all the different facets of the canyon’s charm is to pick a trail and go for a hike. There are many trails along both canyon rims, from short jaunts to all-day treks. Here are a few of our favorites:\nBrink of the Lower Falls Trail (moderate):\nDescend 600 feet on a steep trail to get an up-close and personal view of the Lower Falls in all its thundering power. 0.7 miles, round-trip\nSeven Mile Hole Trail (strenuous):\nYou’ll want to commit a whole day to this trail – the only one that leads to the canyon bottom.10.2 miles, round-trip\nPoint Sublime Trail (easy):\nAfter visiting the Artist Point overlook, follow the South Rim Trail beyond Artist Point to this less-traveled path, which meanders along the canyon rim to the aptly named Point Sublime. 1.3 miles from Artist Point to Point Sublime\nView the Canyon and Falls\nWhile some views of the canyon and falls are only accessible by trail, you can still get to the following overlooks by car and a short walk from the parking lots on paved, accessible walkways.\nFrom North Rim Drive: View the Lower Falls from Lookout Point, Red Rock Point, Grand View, and Inspiration Point. Both waterfalls are visible from Brink of the Lower Falls.\nFrom South Rim Drive: See the Upper Falls from two viewpoints at Uncle Tom’s Point. View the Lower Falls at Artist Point.\nSeveral of the canyon overlooks and trails, which were originally built in the 1930s, are being rehabilitated with support from Yellowstone Forever. Over the years, they have been hammered by unforgiving weather, compromised by soil erosion, and damaged by increased visitation. In recent years, these conditions have prompted some temporary or long-term closures."

     "comment": "We viewed the canyon from the Artist Point lookout and the colors were striking. Their intensity varies with the weather and time of day. Due to the iron content in the rock (largely rhyolite) the reds are like the iron rusting. The yellows are not sulfur but other chemical reactions affecting the iron. It all makes for gorgeous scenery.\nBe sure to walk down to the top of the stairway because on that corner there is a great view of the falls cascading down and glimpses of the river. There are many spectacular places in the Park, but don’t miss this one."

     "comment": "We visited this popular attraction early in the day. Parking was still available and the temperature was still on the cool side. There are several stops on each side of the canyon. When we visited, some were closed for construction (Brink of Upper Falls, North & South Rim Trails & Uncle Tom's Trail). On the South Rim we stopped at Uncle Tom’s Point (great views of Upper Falls) and Artist Point. On the North Rim we stopped at Brink of Lower Falls, Red Rock Point, Lookout Point, Grand View and Inspiration Point. My favorite was Artist Point, the views are excellent from here. Parking lots at most of the spots are big enough for several cars. Most of the sites are within easy walking from the parking lots. The only exceptions are Brink of the Lower Falls and Red Rock Point, the trails drop steeply about 600 feet. The artist Thomas Moran painted many variations of the canyon on his travels here which in turn helped Yellowstone become the first National Park. I recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the day to avoid the crowds and find a parking spot."

You will take countless pictures and not know what to edit. Trust me. The only downside to our visit was a large group of foreign tourists who dominated the area by cutting in front of others to take their photographs. Frustrating but do not be deterred. You will still be able take in the beauty of the park. You will spend a minimum of 30-45 minutes enjoying the view. Enjoy."

This 24 mile long canyon with depth varying from 800 to 1200 ft and width varying from 1500 to 4000 ft at places attests to the potential erosive force of the Yellowstone River. From several vantage points, one can view Lower Falls plunging steeply into the canyon 308 feet, or the Upper Falls tumbling 109 feet. This is the only canyon that sports steam vents and geysers marked by mineral strains on its wall.\nFor thousands of years, upwardly percolating fluids have altered the chemistry of the rocks, turning them yellow, red, white, and pink. A beautiful picturesque setting!\nOnce upon a time when the old geyser basin was active, it contributed to the \"cooking\" of the rock bringing about chemical alterations in the canyon's iron compounds. The rocks are essentially rusting. The colors indicate the presence or absence of water in the individual iron compounds. Most of the yellows in the canyon are the result of iron present in the rock rather than sulfur, as many people think."

If you want a view from the just above the lower falls, you need to have the ability to climb down and back up a trail that drops approximately 700 feet. When you get toward the bottom, you have a couple of options to get fantastic views of the canyon and falls. There are also many other points along the canyon for you to observe so don't make the trip down the trail if you might have an issues."

It is possible a little bit of the rim (some parts without protection, so quite dangerous if you have kids) but for the rest there are beatiful overlooks reachable by car.\nThe canyon itself it is fantastic with colours that are incredible.

To get a great view of the water fall you have to go about 56 stories down and a narrow switch back path and when you go down you have to walk back up it.... but the view is amazing and with it if you can walk it. There are vies for up top and yes it’s amazing to look out and see this Canyon the parking is a bit of a pain especially if you have a big truck but that’s all over Yellowstone we parked at the first. Area and hiked to the viewing area which was nice"

This is the view that Thomas Moran painted in 1871 and which became part of the inspiration for Congress to create the first national park in the world, and for President Grant to sign the bill into law.\nWe also took it in from Lookout Point and Grand View - totally worth taking in both the South Rim and North Rim drives."

We then continued on the South Canyon Rim Trail to take in the views of the Lower Falls then the Upper Falls. Unforgettable!"

I have posted some photos of broken fencing, trails that were closed off due to safety issues, and other maintenance problems. This is the fault of Congress, not the National Parks Service, which has a $12 billion maintenance backlog. If you love your national parks, call your member of Congress and complain about their underfunding of parks. It matters here, where the only thing keeping your precious child from falling over a sheer cliff is a broken fence. Of course your other choice is to pay $50 instead of $35 at the gate next year, but that doesn't seem very American...."

My wife had suggested Yellowstone as a destination and I knew it was going to be impressive, but I had no idea what kind of things we were going to find there. So, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was a total surprise.\nWe saw it on the map, but didn't really take it seriously. Even when we parked the car and followed the clear signposts: it looked like a river carving its own little canyon. But when we stood on the lip of that canyon and looked down at the river and the sulphur deposits that decorated the sides of the enormous canyon! Grand Canyon is no exaggeration. This place is absolutely spectacular. We just couldn't get enough of it.\nWell-marked trails. Safe and well-chosen viewpoints. It was all aid out for us. But we didn't even mind the crowds. Glimpses of coloured deposits turned into dazzling, dramatic canyon views as we made our way through the surrounding trees.\nWe lingered longer than we expected. It never got old."

     "comment": "I was looking forward to seeing this area, after reading the reviews on it. I was a little worried that my expectations were too high. I felt like it looked fake in everyone's pictures. I can now say, it met and exceeded my expectations! It is so beautiful that it does look fake.\nWe drove both the north and south rim to see the different viewpoints. We got to the north rim first, which the ranger said will get more backed up as the day goes on. We didn't have any trouble finding parking, and we were there around 8:30 am. We hiked the trail to the Brink of the Lower Falls and the Red Rock Trail. Both were beautiful and worth it.\nThe Brink of the Upper Falls and Uncle Tom's Trail was closed when we were here on June 25.\nWe did drive on the South Rim Road to Artist's Point is a must as well. This area is very awe-inspiring."

     "comment": "This canyon is located along the main road in Yellowstone on the east side of the park. There are two drives one on the north side of the canyon and one on the south side. The road along the north side is one way and loops back to the canyon visitor center. The views of the huge waterfall is amazing. There are trails or stairs that take you down to see the falls from close to river level but it is a long hard trip back to the parking area. The first stop at brink of the lower falls is one of the best views. Inspiration Point is the last stop on the north rim drive and the view from there is fantastic. All of the overlooks are well worth the time but the first and last to me are best. This drive can be very crowded and there may be waits to find a parking spot. If you can get there early in the day you will have less issues. The south rim drive is a road in and the same path back out. There are several overviews to view the upper falls and all are great. The last is artist point and it to me is the best view. All overviews are an easy walk from the parking. I did not expect the canyon to be one of my favorite things in the park but it was. Don’t miss it."

We took a hike on the north rim, which was just a walk, but more or less straight up and down using a path with many switchbacks. The view at the bottom - right next to the waterfall - was awesome. There are overlooks that are much more accessible too though. And much more crowded."

Both the north and south rim drives are worth doing as they provide a variety of overlooks to see both the canyon and the upper and lower falls. The problem is the popularity of these drives and overlooks means it can be very difficult to get parking Patience and advance planning(come early) reduce the problems. We went on s short hike from the artist point parking lot along the rim of the canyon which was a great way to really see the colors of the canyon. This is not to be missed"

     "comment": "I kept reading about how this place resembled a mini-Grand Canyon, and it really does in many ways. Think we drove through the viewing area on the North side of the canyon (upper) closest to the lodge. Plenty of vehicles, and in fact, parking was at a premium. Thus, 4 stars instead of 5. We enjoyed the various viewpoints that line the parking area, and worked our way all along it. Because the wife was still recuperating from a foot operation, we did not trudge very far down any trails, but we did fine at the viewpoints, some of which have stairways that take you down to overlooks that seem to be right on top of the canyon. It's fun looking at the falls from a distance and watching the way the river churns through the canyon. Loved the canyon and the crevices and precipices, and it was even fun watching folks on the other side of the canyon. But you had better bring binoculars if you really want to savor the details. A hailstorm eventually drove us back to our car and the safety of the cocktail lounge in the village. So there's that, too! Great to have a martini waiting nearby."

I'm not even sure how many switchbacks there are - but there are A LOT and it's all up hill...pretty steep. It takes you down to an upper observation platform and then a lower one that is right next to the raging river and the falls. You are definitely rewarded with some amazing sites if you make it down there. The amazing power of the river and the falls right there at your fingertips and then the majestic views that look more like a painting then real life. It's definitely worth a visit if you are near but be warned that it is NOT an easy walk back up."

I’m however dropping one star due to practicalities - disappointment that several of the trails (including the Uncle Tom Steps) going into the high season are out of use, and also the parking (on the North Rim) - even in early June - is difficult, so goodness knows what it will be like in July/August. Maybe they have more elaborate controls in operation when its busy but if not be prepared to go very early in the day, or take a longish walk down from the Canyon Village (or elsewhere) to avoid the car parks."

Or you can take a trail that is not popular with the bus crowd like The Brink."

While the Upper Falls is impressive, the Lower Falls of the canyon is the real show-stealer. The sheer size of the Lower Falls, the pounding river and the colorful painted canyon walls combine to create an unforgettable picture. Artist’s point and the North Rim Drive are both excellent viewing points. For those who want a closer view and a challenge, tale the 300+ staircase in Uncle Tom’s Trail to get a closer look at the lower Falls."

The best light was surprisingly at noon as it lit up the rock to show the yellow stone of Yellowstone!\nThere will always be loads of people here, but if you can get here early, head to the North part of the canyon first. Walk down to the top of the waterfall (which was very worthwhile despite the uphill climb back) and also walk along the north canyon trail to Artists Point to avoid crowds and have easy parking.\nAlso worth going to see the Upper Falls, quick and easy and you realise how fast the water is flowing. Often rainbows here.\nAn amazing canyon and waterfall which you should have at the top of your must see's in YNP."

If you don't get started until 9am or later, you're dooming yourself to hassle. The best way to see anything in the park is to get out early and make occasional time to see things after dinner.\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a must-see stop."

Its walls pop with stunning yellows, reds and oranges. We spotted steaming features near the Yellowstone River. On the North Rim, we stopped at Inspiration Point and walked down to the brink of the Upper Falls. We also visited Lookout Point and Grand View to see the Lower Falls. On the South Rim, we caught a ranger talk on geology at Artist Point and joined a 90 minute ranger guided walked through .5 miles of the \"back country\", where only 10 percent of visitors ever go. Don't miss this wonderful opportunity to see one of America's treasures."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon area of Yellowstone is one of the most picturesque parts of the park, and very different from the well-known geo-thermal areas. This part of the park is a must see, since it is why the park is called “Yellowstone.” From these overlooks peering into the gorge, you can see the yellow walls of the canyon that gave Yellowstone its name.\nWe visited in late September, and got early starts at the first light of dawn. We were rewarded with incredible views of this area, and at most of the overlooks, we had the park to ourselves. Don’t pay any attention to comparisons to the actual Grand Canyon or to Niagara Falls. Each of the national parks we have visited have their own special beauty and we appreciate each of their unique vistas. The views of Yellowstone Canyon were just extraordinary.\nWe visited North Rim Drive first. This is a one way loop where you can drive and stop at the successive viewpoints to admire this breathtaking area. This worked well for us, since we really don’t hike, but could still experience incredible views with very little effort. We stopped at all of the easy points along the way; Brink of the Lower Falls, Lookout Point, Grandview, and Inspiration Point. Each of these views gave a different view of the gorge and the Lower Falls, and every different view was amazing. Some tourists skip these views and only go to Artists Point. What a huge mistake! Spend the time to explore these other views. You won’t be disappointed!\nJust an FYI. The signage for Inspiration Point is very confusing. The first sign you see is not Lookout Point. It is a trail that has sheer drop-offs, and really should be cordoned off for safety. The actual observation point is at the next sign, and is an area that just opened up from construction. This overlook has numerous steps to the view, and is absolutely stunning. The park really did a great job at this site. Always look for official park signs with maps, which mark the actual overlooks.\nWe then headed back toward Canyon Junction, and turned south to pick up South Rim Drive toward Artists Point. We stopped at the Brink of the Upper Falls, but didn’t go all the way to the observation point. It was somewhat steep, and too difficult for us. We then passed Uncle Tom’s Point, which was still closed for construction. It was supposed to be open by September of 2018, but apparently it is taking longer than expected.\nArtists Point is one of the busier parts of the part. It is probably the most visited of the Yellowstone Grand Canyon overlooks. The view from here is absolutely incredible. Definitely a primo selfie shot! It’s a good idea to get here early, and definitely be patient. Many people setup camera tripods, and there were only a few “holes” in the prime areas for the rest of us to take pictures. But if you persevere, you will get some great shots.\nWe are so glad we spent a couple of hours here to enjoy the many exquisite views of Yellowstone Canyon. If you love beautiful scenic views, you’ll love this part of Yellowstone!"

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone isn't to be confused with the larger and even more magnificent Grand Canyon of the Colorado. But it is big enough and beautiful enough to stir your emotions. Surely, it is one of the most popular attractions in Yellowstone National Park. It is the first large canyon on the Yellowstone River downstream from Yellowstone Falls. It is about 24 miles long, 800 to 1,200 feet in depth and from a quarter-mile to three quarters-of-a-mile wide. Like the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, it is an erosional feature, not a result of glaciation. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than glaciation. Today, it still is being eroded by the Yellowstone River. Perhaps the most picturesque features of the canyon are the upper and lower falls. But there are other important landmarks, including Agate Creek, Artist Point, Calcite Spring, Cascade Creek, Inspiration Point, Grand View, Lookout Point, Overhanging Cliff, Point Sublime, 7-Mile Hole and Silver Cord Cascade. For ambitious and curious tourists who want to get a closer view of the canyon and the lower falls, perhaps the canyon's most spectacular feature, they are encouraged to tackle the Uncle Tom's Trail, which is a three-mile hike along the steep stairway down the base of the lower falls."

The hikes and walks range from easy to more difficult, but all have a different perspective and a beauty of their own."

It is probably the most awe inspiring sight in Yellowstone - if geography is your thing if postcard picture sights are what you seek in a park. Obviously in Yellowstone the geology of the geothermal features and the wildlife are two other attractions that may be your primary reason for visiting. So this is best in class, but not necessarily best overall."

Interesting enough, we were told by our National Park Ranger guide that during the winter when it is really cold, these falls actually freeze. The water under the surface still is rushing. Then when it warms up, the frozen ice falls with a loud crash! You also need to stop at another parking lot and see the upper falls which is an awesome. So make sure you stop at both viewing places."

We had purchased several years ago The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass so we were able to get into the park without paying an extra fee. We have the Senior Pass. We got to the site where Old Faithful would make a show for all to see. There were may seats available around the area yet people had to sit on the concrete at our feet due to the crowd waiting for the Geyser to erupt. When it erupted on time, the display went on for about three minutes. It was wonderful!\nOther things that we was were people fishing in the streams, people watching other eruptions in several other spots in the park, and last but not least a bison walking up the side of the road."

Withstanding hiking, we could have seen all the highlights in two days. Old Faithful did not disappoint. I wasn’t sure I cared about seeing but it really was a thrill. Nice area to stop at.\nPainters pots were interesting, the canyons, Hayden and Lamar valleys for wildlife. We went to Lamar valley at sunrise and it was beautiful. Didn’t see the wolves, however but they were there the day before. Mammoth springs were interesting and the area has a decent restaurant. Drove several miles back there another day to have breakfast."

     "comment": "Yellowstone is one of the most amazing places on the planet, and its Grand Canyon is stunningly beautiful.\nThere are several viewing platform areas - take the time to check them all out. Each one gives a different perspective and angle. The sheer size of the canyon, coupled with the drama of fast-falling water, plus the unusual color of the rock walls make this a must-see. See if you can spot a few small steam vents in the canyon walls.\nThere's a great, short video on the NPS site about the falls. It contains excellent, concise information that will aide you before your visit.\nIn a huge, must-see national park filled with must-see attractions, I can see why some might miss this one. If, like most people, you enter YNP from the south gate and travel, clockwise, you will have to travel a bit to get to the canyon. Ideally, it will be your second or third day of your visit.\nDo not miss out. If you enjoy nature (which is why we visit Yellowstone, right?) take the time to see this part. While the thermal features are like visiting another planet, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is one of the most beautiful parts of this planet."

With some of the exposed rock in black color, it makes for an interesting and surreal image, almost like looking at a painting. Also, the Grand Canyon in Yellowstone is closer to the observation viewpoints, which gives it a more intimate feeling. This is a must see attraction. Both the Lookout Point on the North Rim Drive and the Artist Point on the South Rim Drive offers great vantage points of both the Lower Falls and the Canyon. The Calcite Springs Overlook also offers a great vantage point for just the Canyon itself and is less crowded."

You will also never see the exact view of the Moran painting because it is a compilation of views. Bring your hiking boots. Hike the north lower falls trails and do it at dawn. No one will be there and your drive through the park to get to the canyon will be unmatched. Steam rising everywhere, fog patches, foraging animals, and then the hike down to the crest of the falls. The mist at dawn catches sunlight and reflects colors from the walls. Hike the northern rim after - its relatively flat. You’ll mostly be alone or meet a couple of other dawn enthusiasts."

Some of the south rim areas were closed when we were there but the trail from Wapati trailhead to Ribbon Lake is a good one to do. The driving route on the north rim offers a number of good viewpoints too."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon here of course is nothing like the Grand Canyon in Arizona - it's much narrower, more like a deep gorge, but the view is spectacular nevertheless. The river is a much more brilliant green next to the amazingly colorful palette of the Canyon walls. There are many lookout points on both north and south rims. Stop at all of them if you have the time, but if not, here are 3 of my favorites:\nArtist Point - on the south rim, gives you a sweeping, distant view of the falls. Tends to get overcrowded so best to go early or late in the day. For more solitude and more views of the Canyon hike a bit on the Point Sublime trail (look for the sign marked Ribbon Lake). Trail is a mile one way but no need to go all the way as the best views are half way in.\nBrink of Lower Falls - right off the north rim drive, requires a very steep hike down and up (0.75 miles one way) to the viewing platform. A must see if you like standing almost next to the bottom of a huge thundering waterfall.\nBrink of Upper Falls - Off the loop road just south of the north rim drive - not far from the parking lot, just a few steps down. We stopped here as a last minute add on at the end of the day but it was totally worth it. Nothing like being right next to a raging river rushing towards the lip of the fall. If you like the deafening noise of water plunging down this is a good spot to be.\nIn addition to the Canyon and falls, we also found the stretch of the loop road between Tower and Canyon junctions to have the best bear sightings. Two in one day - grizzly and black bear with cub!"

Powerful to stand next to them. Then be sure to see the Brink of upper falls which is an easy short walk from parking lot. And finally Artist Point has some amazing views across the canyon to see the falls. Disappointed Uncle Tom’s trails down the canyon side was closed due to construction but if you visit these 3 spots you can still see it all. Stop by Falls cafe for burger fries and a shake at the Canyons."

     "comment": "I would recommend doing Artist Point on the South Rim first thing in the morning to avoid long waiting lines (for parking) and crowded platforms (tourists buses come in in hoards). Artist Point has undoubtedly the best view of the canyon, and is one of the most photographed spots in the park.\nAfter that do the North Rim, which is usually less crowded. The North Rim has great hikes with various entry points along the Rim. The hikes range from I would say 1-2 miles - so they’re short, but relatively steep. We did it with 10 and 12-yr old boys, and they were completely fine doing the trails. We saw people of all ages going the trails.\nThe first is a trail to the Brink of the Lower Falls - this takes you right to the top of the Falls where it comes down. Amazing view to see such enormous volume to water gushing down the canyon. From here, you can either walk down to the next trail (this walk is a trail in itself), or drive to the next stop. Here, there’s a Grand View (right at the entrance of the trail - view is ok, not great). From here there’s a Red Rock trail going down. This is probably the best trail on the North Rim, pretty good views of the Canyon.\nAll in all, doing the South and North Rim with the hikes should take around two hours, maybe slightly longer depending on your hiking speed and the time you spend at the viewing platforms."

Then, we walked down to the top of the falls........AMAZING....the roar of the water rushing over the rocks was so loud! The way down is easy......of course......the way back up is UP.....and UP......but they have places to rest at almost every switchback so take it slow and easy and advantage of them but don't miss the viewpoint. Shady most of the way and footing is pretty easy and level. I appreciated my hiking shoes but tennis shoes work too. Plenty of bathrooms and also plenty of people so be patient......but GO!"

If you stay at Canyon Lodge, there is an easy path through the woods to walk over to the North Rim so you don’t have to fight over parking. As most people seem to drive through YNP and only jump out to take photos to say they have “seen” YNP, I cannot stress enough to visit this location early in the day or late afternoon to avoid all the annoying tourists."

We didn’t see any wildlife on the road there, but we already had our fill in the Lamar Valley. We reached Canyon Village and then passed the entrance to the North Rim drive (which was jammed with cars) and kept going a few miles to the South Rim drive. At the end of the road is a lookout called Artist Point. Less cars and a large parking lot so it was easier to reach. There were probably 150 people at the lookout and the views were spectacular. It was definitely worth the drive."

I’m in great physical shape but was panting on the uphill because of the altitude. Definitely not recommended for small children or elderly folks we saw too many small children crying and parents who had to make the climb carrying children...in 90 degree heat. In my opinion, children under 8 won’t be able to appreciate it anyway so just stay at the top and have an enjoyable day. For everyone else, the strenuous climb is well worth it. There are viewing outlooks in several places that make for great pictures, but you must wait your turn because of the crowds. As long as you aren’t in a hurry, it is an amazing sight to see."

It can be very warm so make sure that you have plenty of water with you. The views are beautiful and seem better at every site. Another way to see the canyon is on horseback. There is a stable nearby. The day we visited the canyon our visit was interrupted by a thunder and lightning storm that made us seek shelter in one of the Park resturants. The main hike of hundreds of steps into the canyon that my son wanted to take was closed because of construction. A lot of construction is going on throughout the park in the summer so you never know what will be available."

That night I thought there should be a better way to see Yellowstone. I found a GyPSy guide app and installed it on my phone. It needs to downloaded BEFORE you go to the park. This app was wonderful! It was like having our own tour guide. This app made a HUGE difference in our trip. The app is only $9.99 for Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. We found our trip to be much more relaxing and educational. We visited Yellowstone Grand Canyon the first day and could not find a parking space. One of the parking lots was closed down. The front clerk at the hotel told us to leave for the park before 6:30 and we will get through before the crowd. What a difference it made for us! We went to Yellowstone Grand Canyon and had no crowds. We took a trail down close to the bottom. It is so beautiful!"

We arrived at artist view at 8:30 and parking was filling up and followed with the brink which was almost full. (Early evening probably good too) it is definitely worth it. While the thermal areas of the park get a lot of press, this area is every bit as inspiring. Even with the challenge of construction, you can still get great views and of course there is the option of hiking in the canyon area. Definitely don’t miss stopping here!"

     "comment": "Sometimes you see images in a book or on the internet, and think: I would like to see this. It may a disappointment, a 'this is what I expected' or a WOW experience when you do see it. This one is for sure a WOW!\nTo start with a less positive thing: you need to drive a long time (we entered via the West entrance) to get here. If there are queues on the road (in case animals walk close to or on the road), you easily need 1:30-2:00 to get here. The views are very impressive, viewpoints can be reached by car, often combined with short trails (typically < 0.5 mile)\nI read in some comments a comparison with the Grand Canyon. It is a totally different type of canyon, the advantage of this one is that it is smaller and you can have a better total picture and can see the river and waterfalls.\nApart from the awesome views, you can also walk to the upper and lower falls. A lot of trails were closed at the lower falls though since they were rebuilding some sections. Good they do this, but unfortunate if you intended to hike in that area.\nApart from the viewpoints where you can see a big section of the canyon, I like the fact that you can walk till the section where the water dives of the upper falls."

The hikes to the top of the falls lead to great views (the lower falls hike especially is strenuous and I wouldn't recommend it for those with health issues). When we went in July 2018 the Uncle Tom trail was closed and did not look like it would re-open in the near future."

Unfortunately, Inspiration Point, Uncle Tom’s Trail, and the North Rim trails all are closed for the year due to construction.

We also did a back country hike from a fork in the same trail to Ribbon Lake - end was a little anti climatic and trail was buggy. You can skip those two miles but do the one miler (round trip) to Sublime Point for sure. Get there early because this lot is a traffic jam in the summer by 10am, or after 5."

Hike on the other side of the canyon near Lamar valley (Yellowstone river trail) and we were alone for hours. There are ways to find solace in this park, if you’re willing to put in some effort :) The canyon is beautiful and worth seeing from all angles."

Because of the name one's tempted to compare it with The Grand Canyon in Arizona-- they are similar only in that they are both canyons with a river. The falls are high and you can get very close. There's an area that you can descend steep stairs to the river. Even if you are in good shape remember you're at 8000' and it may be a struggle. But if you can make it without a lot of pain it's definitely spectacular."

We’ve been to Yellowstone twice now for over a week each visit & still not managed to do it all. The Canyon is 1 of the must see’s if you’re only visiting for a short time & it’s very close to Canyon Village which is a good stop for toilets, drinks, lunch, gift shops & bear spray rentals."

If you have the opportunity to visit the Park GO! It is well worth the hikes/drive/time to see this beautiful place. We stayed in the park for 10 hours and it wasn't long enough...plan a few days to see everything...your ticket is good for 7 days."

I’ve see the Grand Canyon (in Arizona) and this view tops it. Won’t go so far as saying the canyon is better, but the view of the falls and the beautiful green water rushing down the canyon with those wonderfully colored walls (reddish brown) is just an incredible sight. Wow!"

Get there ahead of the crowds and enjoy the beauty. The waterfall is incredible. If you're feeling energetic, do the hike down at Lookout Point. It's a steep climb, but well worth it. There is no hike at the Grand View stop, but incredible scenery everywhere you look. Leaving the parking lot at the Grand View stop, we saw a mama bear and her cubs. That caused a bear jam out of the lot! There are bathrooms at the Lookout Point lot."

The only real downside is that the colors of the canyon don't translate to photos. You really just have to take it all in when you're there and commit to memory. We got lucky and went at a time when there were not scores of people milling about, but the area can definitely become crowded quickly! this is a MUST SEE, so be sure to add it to any trip you've planned to YNP."

     "comment": "Although I have been to YNP hundreds of times, this remains one of the highlights of my trips. The scenery is spectacular and the beauty and majesty of the waterfall and the river down below make this one of the \"must see\" places in the park. There are several trails that you can go on for different places along the rim of the canyon. Uncle Tom's Trail is currently closed because they are totally remodeling that area, but there is Inspiration point, and Artist's point that can give you some spectacular views.\nIf you want to be there at the best times, go early in the morning before the tour buses and most of the people crowd up the area, or in the early evening when it gets a bit cooler.\nThere can be deerflies/horseflies and mosquitoes so be sure to take some insect repellent to keep them at bay. It can be very hot and sunny so be sure to wear sunscreen and appropriate head covering."

The canyon is approx 20 miles long, 4,000 feet wide in parts and 1,000 deep. The canyon walls and rocks are multi colours of red, orange and gold as basically the rocks oxidise ( rust ) over time. It gets very very crowded so if you can go around 7-8am. Its a must see site."

Just drive around the circle until someone leaves and you can take their place. The good news is, if you have someone in your party that has mobility issues, you can take this slowly and get there to see the falls. Don't try to use a walker - use a cane. It's a stunning sight, an amazing, powerful waterfall. If you don't have mobility issues, the hike to Point Sublime (a dirt foot path that takes off up from the paved area) is worth the hike for more remarkable beauty, wow color... but it's a hike in all senses of that word."

It's a pleasant walk from the parking lot to the viewpoint, not to mention a great opportunity to stretch your legs after all the driving. The view is amazing.\nIf you're photographically minded, this is very similar to the other Grand Canyon in that the canyon itself is rather wide with the water (details) being a bit distant. The difference is that here you'll likely want to capture some of those distant details. The viewpoint is a bit small so you'll have to work around the other spectators.\nPlan on spending 45-90 minutes here."

The hike then took us away from the crowds into bear country. With our bear spray in hand, we walked through wildflower scattered meadows, along Clear Lake and through the bubbling thermals and mud pots."

Although you can view this from various lookouts, to get an up-close view of the canyon, I would highly advise doing a hike to the brim of lower falls. However, be advised that the hike is short... 3/8th of a mile... but steep with 600 ft elevation drop/gain. And mind you, ascent is the second half of the trail. But.... so worth it. Highly recommend."

     "comment": "Since I can't find an overall site for review of Yellowstone, I'll enter it here. Yellowstone has many wonderful attractions including the Grand Canyon. There are many warning signs throughout the parking about the dangers of animals and hot springs, HOWEVER there are few warning signs about other dangers. For example, the view of the falls from the southern rim has NO signs warning of the danger that exists from this viewpoint. They simply have some boulders about 2 feet high separating the visitors from the edge of the cliff. I personally saved a small boy that was climbing on them and came close to going over the edge, and who's parents weren't watching him. The loop road that goes through the park is very narrow in most places AND there are many, many miles of it in which there are no guardrails making it very treacherous and nerve racking driving. Sooo, if you don't like mountain driving you might want to think about taking a tour. The drive to this area from Tower Roosevelt is the worst, climbing very high up through the mountains. There are some guardrails but not near enough. Going south you are in the inside lane as you climb, but if you return this way, you will be in the outside lane and there are NO guardrails and there are steep drop-offs. The edge of the road is very close to the drop off. I am very disappointed by the management of this park. The roads should have been widened long ago AND many guardrails added. They focus so much on the dangers of animals that they forget about the other dangers that exist in the park for which nothing is being done. Parking in viewing areas is also very bad. There are millions of trees in the park and the park service is so bent on preserving the park, that they are stingy in chopping down a few trees to add more parking space, which I think is just ridiculous. While Yellowstone is a beautiful park, it definitely needs better management."

We visited the third week in May and found the water levels to be very high, the river was roaring. We opted to hike the ¾ mile down the steep train to the lower falls observation point located immediately next to the edge of the cliff the water drops off. The hike was totally worth the effort. The path still showed signs of the recent snow melt. In fact, the path to the upper falls was still closed. The large parking lot was mostly empty."

The Grand View overlook was much less crowded and the views are nearly as good as the Brink of the Lower Falls. Get your \"been there, done that\" shot at the Lower Falls and then move up to Grand View to drink in the splendiforous essence of Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. A definite highlight of our trip."

There may be others but the overlook we stopped at, had wonderful expansive views of the falls as well as the canyon walls carved out by the river. As I will suggest in any review of major park attractions, get there early since if the road to get there is open, its tourist season. So most scenic outlooks like this draw pretty big crowds which kind of takes away from the peacefulness you would get from this place without the crowds."

     "comment": "This area of YNP is located at the point where the lower loop joins the upper loop, on the right or east side of the lower loop. The place is very crowded daily in the Summer so keep patient with the traffic jams that are experienced so frequently. The weather is also subject to change dramatically, as the rain came quickly and changed an 80 degree day into the fifties, with hail, thunder, and lightning within minutes!\nThere are two distinct areas to visit, the lower canyon view and the upper \"ledge\" walkway. The lower view provides spectacular views of both the Upper and the Lower Falls. You can walk part of the way onto the lookouts. In August of 2017 the other walkway was closed for the Summer due to construction.\nThe walk on the Upper Canyon road is the most spectacular since you can walk within feet of the Falls, as you watch the rushing water pass by only a few feet from you, just before the water tumbles down the very high Falls. This is possible only after a somewhat strenuous walk down many stone, wet stairs to the small balcony at the top of the Falls. On the ridge walkway you can see down over the deep cliffs into the Canyon's bottom below, and still get views of the Falls and other beautiful scenery. This area is a must-see for your visit to YNP."

     "comment": "There are many easy views from the rim that are great, such as Artist's Point or Grand View. However, my favorite view of the lower falls is from Red Rock Lookout. It does involve a bit of a hike down into the canyon on a well done trail. It is well worth the effort. If you are more ambitious, you can hike lower into the canyon and closer to the lower falls by hiking Uncle Tom's Trail. Also fine views. It is hard to go wrong at any of the canyon viewpoints. Note the canyon is great in any season, although in the winter or spring - snow can limit access."

It stops for scheduled heated restroom breaks and sights along the way. It also stops when animals are sighted and everyone can get out and take photos.

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a 24 mi/39 km canyon between Tower Fall and Yellowstone Falls. There are 2 main drives:\n1) North Rim Drive: Brink of Upper Falls Trail, Brink of Lower Falls Trail, Inspiration Point, Red Rock Point, Lookout Point, Grand View Point\n2) South Rim Drive: Artist Point, Uncle Tom's Trail (closed until Fall 2019)\nHikers can opt to do the North Rim Trail (partially closed between Brink of Lower Falls Trail and Brink of Upper Falls Trail until Fall 2019) and South Rim Trail (closed until Fall 2019) instead of the drives.\nMy husband and I visited in August. As hikers, we were disappointed that we could not hike the South Rim Trail, including Uncle Tom's Trail, which takes you to the base of Lower Falls. However, we understand the importance of maintaining this natural beauty and hope to return when construction is completed. We did the North Rim Drive around 6pm on Saturday and the South Rim Drive around noon on Sunday. We recommend doing the drives either early or later in the day as there is limited parking. We had no trouble finding parking at the various view points on North Rim Drive at 6pm but had to park on the side of the road instead of the designated parking lot at Artist Point.\nThe Brink of Upper Falls Trail and Brink of Lower Falls Trail are 0.4 mi/0.6 km each and really do take you to the brink of the falls. While all the viewpoints were pretty, Artist Point was the most scenic and memorable. If you have time for only 1 viewpoint in Yellowstone, make it Artist Point."

You just have to do both !!! You will get fantastic views, up close and personal, of the Upper Falls, the Lower Falls and of course the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, as you walk along the rim of each side of the canyon.\nMake sure you the do Brink of the Upper Falls lookout, and the Brink of the Lower Falls viewpoint, be sure to do Lookout Point, Grand View...all on the North Rim. Then make sure you do the Upper Falls view, Uncle Tom's Point, Uncle Tom's Trail, and Artist Point...all on the South Rim.\nTruly an incredibly wondrous creation !!!\nEither go to Yellowstone NP in the Spring, before Memorial Day weekend, or in the early fall, after Labor Day weekend...if your schedule allows. You will avoid the huge tourist crowds, congestion, noise, and all that goes along with the summer crush !!! We went the first full week after Labor Day weekend, and the crowds were GONE. Easy to park, no congestion, in some places hardly any people, saw a lot of wildlife as they were content to come back into view now that the people had left. But be sure to bring layers of clothes, as temps can be comfortable during the day, but can be quite cold in the evening. We even experienced snow and freezing temps a couple of our days visiting !!!\nTake lots of photos...Enjoy !!!"

Our guide was very friendly, upbeat and kept us well informed of the many sites we saw on this 8 hour journey. The views just kept getting better from Norris Geyser to the upper and lower falls of the Canyon to the wildlife surrounding Yellowstone Lake. There were several stops along the way for rest room and snack breaks and the tour price does include a box lunch. This was an ideal way to spend Christmas Eve day with crisp winter images that look like they just came out of a holiday postcard.\nOur pictures bring back fond memories we will always treasure. Having been to Yellowstone the last 2 Christmas vacation, the Canyon Day Tour is my favorite and I would strongly recommend it. Please note that our day was sunny, about 8 degrees, and gorgeous blue sky."

There are several stops on each side of the canyon, some are closed for construction (Inspiration Point, part of the north rim trail, and Uncle Tom's Point). We stopped at Artist Point, Brink of the Upper Falls, Lower Falls, Lookout Point, and Grand View. My favorite was Artist Point, the views are excellent from here. Parking lots at most of the spots are big enough for several cars. Most of the sites are within easy walking from the parking lots. The only exception is Brink of the Lower Falls, the trail drops steeply about 600 feet to the falls. Some reviews compare this to the Grand Canyon in Arizona, but there is no comparison. This is unique and beautiful in its own way. This is a must stop when visiting the park. If you can only see one part of the canyon, I recommend Artist Point. I also recommend arriving early to avoid the major crowds."

We had beautiful 'winter wonderland' views in the morning, then as it warmed up and the clouds opened up, we had equally nice 'Fall' viewing!\nIf there is snow, just be prepared for slippery conditions on the switchbacks until the snow and slush is gone.\nHint: Always carry a case of water and cooler of food items anytime you are in the park because the weather/road conditions can change quickly. Also keep extra clothing on hand just in case. We would love to come back here again."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is one of the most visited destinations in the park. This is for good reason. The views of the canyon are simply amazing, and there is nothing else like it. The Yellowstone River, combined with unique volcanic activity, has created a very interesting canyon with rock formations and colors that are unlike anything else I've seen.\nThere are roads that go along the upper rim and part of the lower rim. There's plenty of parking on the upper rim, so you can stop at various places to walk and take pictures. I recommend hiking down to the brink of the lower falls and lookout point.\nConstruction at the time prevented us from reaching Inspiration Point, but it likely had a similar view to the other locations we did see.\nBottom line: Be sure to check out the Grand Canyon when in Yellowstone."

     "comment": "I've been to the Grand Canyon and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and they are both awesome - amazing for different reasons. This one is so dramatic and Yellowstone falls looks incredible as it flows fiercely all year round. Is easy to get to, just check your park map when you arrive, and parking is easy - it's a very short walk to the overlook (look for 'artists point' on south rim drive). Would definitely recommend this as one of Yellowstone's best attractions. If you want to see it from a different perspective, you can do a very steep, but fair short hike to the top of the lower falls (take lower falls trail from north rim drive). It's important to note these two different views are on opposite sides of the Canyon - chittenden bridge will take you over the river."

Hikes into the canyon only go down so far, but offer great views of the brink of the lower falls and from the red rock observation point. Both are recommended. Hard to pick out a favorite spot at Yellowstone but this would be right up at the top."

This was our first stop of the day, arriving before 10 am. All was good. By 11:15 the place was a madhouse. Tour buses bringing loads of travelers packing the trails and walkways. Regardless of your park destination, my advice is to get there as early as possible. We found that by early afternoon we were ready to be free of the crowds. Do notice warnings before walking down to the observations decks as this is a very tough return back to the top. Was hoping the end of August was going to be a bit quieter. We still had a blast!"

It is absolutely incredible that there is such diversity in this park and a canyon is just one of many.\nThe parking lot is big so plenty of room. It was pouring with rain the day we visited but the place was still packed with tourists. The main viewing area, like many in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, was CROWDED so you had to wait to get a good picture etc.\nEasy walk from the parking lot to viewing areas and of course the Falls can be seen here too. Glad we saw it but we were wowed more by some of the other sights."

Pick up a National Park Service Canyon Trail Guide before you go. It would not be a complete visit without doing at least a couple of trails. On the south rim Uncle Tom's was closed for construction. The South Rim Trail offers beautiful canyon views, but limited views of the Falls, but you must go to Artist Point. On the North Rim the Red Rock Point Trail offers incredible views of the Falls but is very steep."

They do throw off brilliant shades of yellows, oranges, browns, pinks, etc. and contrasted next to the blues/greens of water, sky and foliage it is easy to see why overlooks have names like Inspiration Point, Artists Point, etc.\nThis area is less known than Old Faithful but just as, well, Grand.\nDefinitely worth a visit -- drive the upper and lower canyon roads (or hike the trails) to take in the overlooks."

They are mostly level and the views make them easy to handle. Each section has a different view of the canyon and/or the river, so try to make time to stop at each one. Like everything in the park, parking can get to be a problem at these popular stops, so try to go early or later in the day if you can. If not, just make another loop, chances are good that someone will be leaving and open up a space."

     "comment": "While not as overwhelming in size as Arizona's Grand Canyon, this is beautiful. The South Rim offers views that are much more readily accessible and, IMHO, far more striking. The North Rim views are limited unless you're willing and able to hike moderate distances (and inclines) which, for older folks, can be a challenge. Between the wildfire smoke and the altitude, the hiking part proved a bit too much for us. The South Rim was much easier and offered a couple of overlooks that provided incredible views."

I'd recommend getting there early (8 am or so) because the light is great for photos and the crowds are not there yet. When we visited, the rest of the So. Rim Drive stops (Uncle Tom's, So. Rim trail) were closed for renovation which I believe will continue into 2018) so check with the park website on their status if they are important to your visit.\nWe then drove to the North Rim. We did the four outlook hikes:\nThe Lower Falls hike is worth doing and while there are a few switch backs it is not overly strenuous\nLook outpoint is an easy walk to the edge of the canyon with great views of the falls.\nThe Red Rock hike is strenuous, with lots of stairs and switch backs but the view and photos you can get of the falls are worth the work. I highly recommend this hike.\nthe Grand view trail is a short easy walk to the edge, again great views of the canyon\nAs of Sept 2017, the Inspiration Point Rd and trail were closed for renovations. Check with the park website on when it will reopen in 2018.\nNote: most but not all of the restrooms are pit toilets, if that is an issue Brink of the Lower Falls overlook has regular restrooms\nBe sure and see the canyon while you are in Yellowstone."

Strangely I haven't heard of this canyon prior to visiting Yellowstone but with the combination of a beautiful talls falls (twice the height of Niagara Falls), pine forest, and canyon, this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen and it was entirely created by nature and preserved by the national park service.\nThere is a north rim and south rim. The road goes fairly close to multiple sites on both rims. You can hike around both rims (short distance). You can't hike down to the canyon. If you want to see the river, go upstream to the Yellowstone lake or downstream to the hike by Tower Falls or much later driving north out of Yellowstone on highway 89."

     "comment": "If you ever wondered why it is called the Yellowstone, visit to this canyon will answer that question. Not obvious in other parts for Yellowstone, NP, the yellow (and other color rocks) carved out and exposed by the Yellowstone river falls are quite a sight. Be sure to visit the Artist Point on the East side, as well as all the vista points on the west at Upper and Lower Falls. View will of course vary as the day progresses. Mornings are likely to be clear with clouds (and thunderstorms) rolling in later in the day."

     "comment": "Yellowstone National Park\nBefore a visit you really have to do some research. The ideal is to stay in the park, which takes a year of lead time or guts and luck. We are always impressed at the quality and service provided by the NPS. Our nation does some things well.\nI think it's important to plan the spots you really want to see. Plan on picnics and several hikes. Without planning you will spend too much time in a car. Our favorite was the canyon at the upper and lower falls. Truly amazing, it explains why the park is named Yellowstone.\nWith no reservations, we found cancellations at several of the prime resorts. That's the guts and luck part. If you find nothing, your forced to stay at one of the fringe towns outside the parks entrance. This option increases your drive time and many of the accommodations are also filled during the summer season. Not the easiest NP to enjoy but well worth the effort."

It is a breathtaking sight which can be enjoyed from a series of viewpoints (with ample parking) along both rims. The waterfall at the head of the canyon can be viewed from several locations along either rim, the best probably being Grand View. Artist Point, Lookout Point, Grand View and Upper Falls View are all well worth a visit to get a different perspective on this extraordinary canyon. When we visited the points on the north rim were significantly less busy than on the south, but this could just be a quirk of wherever the many coachloads of tourists happened to be at the time!"

But don't skip them! They're among the most beautiful, inspiring sites in the park. Get there early- like 7:00 a.m. early- to have your pick of parking spots, photo ops and trails. Morning 'Must See's' open now on the South Rim: 1) entire Artist's Point viewing area, all 3 levels offer different views 2) a walk of any length on the trail to Point Sublime (many points along this path that we label 'Point Good Enough' if not enough time to do the entire trail!) Afternoon/Evening Must See's open on the North Rim are: 1) Upper Falls Overlook and 2) Inspiration Point. If you go when everything is open again, visit everything on the map on both rims- you won't regret it. Spend the night, go to the North Rim during afternoon/evening and do the South Rim in the morning for the best light for photos. Opinions vary on this, but we've been coming here since the 70's & our pictures tell the story."

There are different points to view it from, but Artist Point is an absolute must if you want to get the shot on all the postcards. Get there early, like before 9am, if you want to make it easy to find a parking space. Also, it put's the morning light on the falls for a better picture. There's a chance of a rainbow, too, around 9:30-10am, over the falls. There are basically 3 drives with stops you need to make to see the canyon area, all very close to each other. One is South Rim Drive, which includes Uncle Tom's Trail (currently closed for repairs) and Artist Point. The next is Brink of the Upper Falls. The third is North Rim Drive, which includes Lookout Point, Grand View, and Inspiration Point (also currently closed). All the drives come off of the Grand Loop Road, and are basically just 5-10 minutes away from the Canyon Village area where there is dining, a general store, and a visitor center."

     "comment": "The beauty of this pace takes your breath away. I consider this a \"must stop\" point. You can park at several different places along the way as you get to see and appreciate the magnificence of the canyon. In peak hours day during summer time it can be challenging to find a spot as parking is limited but if you are patient you always find one. The stop is not long (stop, go take a look, take pictures.. admire the place.. then off to the next) so there is always someone leaving every few minutes. We personally found that the best times are before 10 am and after 4 pm, and you also get the benefit of not catching the heat as much either if you come early (and is summer time). You can (of course) drive there at any time but expect crowds between 10 am & 4 pm so patience is key. Remember to park in designated areas as Park Rangers and Patrols are always around."

We would have loved to have hiked along the canyon, but all the trails were closed. There is parking on both sides, although the eastern side is more crowded, with less parking. Be patient and parking spaces will open up. Viewing the canyon does not take that long on that side. Some of our pictures look like postcards, like it is not real. Just amazing."

It's a highly visited place so expect traffic and perhaps a search for a parking place. Park police patrol the area so be careful where you park! It's a short walk from the parking lot to the Canyon and well worth the time. There are excellent views of the falls and the canyon from the South side of the loop. We did not do the north loop of spend anytime at the Canyon Village. A must see."

You really must see every part of the North Rim (extremely crowded), Brink of the Falls (literally hanging on the edge of the Falls) and South Rim, all within a couple of miles. If you can make it, take one of the trails down into the Canyon (very steep and narrow and probably a 700' drop - think 40+ stories.) You may wait 15 or more minutes for a parking space on the North Rim Loop. Spaces open up further along, but everyone just waits for one in the first lot! Walk the rim trail - if it gets too steep, walk along the road for that part. FYI: Inspiration Point is closed indefinitely - looks like it was falling into the Canyon! Uncle Toms is also closed for a major renovation so a spectacular set of stairs into the Canyon is closed.."

If I had to choose between the Tetons and Yellowstone, I would definitely choose the Tetons... the other 4 families traveling with this tour agreed."

Traffic might be heavy especially if there is wildlife on the roads (We were in a bison-related traffic jam for about 45 minutes), but take the drive around the loop from Old Faithful to the Canyon - you won't regret it! There are many areas you can stop, park, and get out for different angles of the falls. There are walking paths that take you even closer although we didn't have time to go on them. No matter what you do in Yellowstone, make sure the Grand Canyon is part of it!"

     "comment": "Driving the great loop road requires patience. It is common to have long delays for animals wandering on the highway or road work. The pullouts for attractions are always full and crowded, parking can be a challenge, especially for large vehicles pulling travel trailers and motor homes. The traffic in the park is starting to overwhelm the parks ability to accommodate it. Some of the heavily traveled trails around the attractions are in disrepair. Yellowstone is where cultures collide. Be ready to encounter bus loads of foreign visitors that don't have time to respect your space, their goal is to quickly get their pictures and get back to the bus. So sit back and relax put your favorite music on the IPOD. It's all part of the experience."

This walk is a 600 foot drop in elevation with many switchbacks on pavement that is sandy and broken up. We braved the walk and were so happy we did. Standing on the brink of the falls and looking out at the canyon as the river winds through the canyon walls is amazing. This is not a walk for anyone that has trouble going up and down hills without side rails. Wear sneakers or hiking shoes, not sandals! There are other spots that are easier to access along the rim but the best is the lower falls."

My husband and I arrived somewhat early (7-8 am) and it was already starting to get pretty busy and I think this is a pretty popular spot so if you really want to spend a lot of time here and get it to yourself you'd need to go early. It does have a pretty big parking lot and a two leveled lookout platform. In my opinion, this is a quick stop but a must stop! You won't be sorry for battling the crowds even."

It is very easy to pull off and walk back a little bit and take some pictures. We visited both rims. You get different views of the waterfalls from each rim. Our favorite was \"Artist's Point\" at the South Rim. There is a fabulous view of the waterfall from there. We had a perfect day with beautiful blue skies above which contrasted just right with the earthy tones of the canyon. Just stunning."

There were lots of great views of the Canyon along the way, though we were a bit disappointed of the view from Point Sublime. There were definitely better views on the hike up than from Point Sublime."

They are constantly working on roads and trails, it is a very real possibility that some of this area will be closed."

There is a walking trail that extends out of the main viewing area that is a leisurely walk with magnificent views. I figure less than 10% of overall visitors walk this trail so it’s a wonderful opportunity to see the sights away from the masses.\nThe views from both sides of the canyon are simply unforgettable!"

The canyon was very cool, loved the multiple waterfalls. It was not too busy. We stayed in Cody and left at 5 am to get in the park. Did this for two days and tried to see the busy things before 12 and spent the afternoons in more quite areas. When we drove back past this at 2 in the afternoon, there was no way to even get in. Go Early!"

The waterfalls are amazing and the colors of the canyon walls are unbelievable and beautiful. Artist Point is one of the best places to see the canyon and the falls and the lookout point is only a short walk from the parking lot. The area can get very crowded, but it is worth visiting."

     "comment": "Artists point and Sublime Point in the South Rim of the Canyon, Brink of Upper Falls, Brink of Lower Falls, Red Rock Point and Grand View in the North Rim all offer varying vantage points of the Canyon, the mighty Falls and the Yellowstone River. Except for the Artists Point, Brink of Upper Falls and Grand View, the rest requires a long and relatively challenging hikes, especially the Brink of Lower Falls; however, each one is a must see!\nThe Sublime Point, in my humble opinion is over rated. Reaching the end of the .5 mile rugged trail and seeing the view made me exclaim \"That' it?\". Along the trail from Artists to Sublime Point, there are several pleasantly overwhelming view angles of the canyon and Yellowstone River.\nDespite the fact that Uncle Tom's Trail is under maintenance and, therefore, closed, our number of steps for the day exceeded 17,000. We hiked to the Red Rock Point on another day.\nFood at the Canyon Village is good with healthy choices. The pulled park sandwich with salad is delicious."

We prefer to go up to the second area where you can get a look at the falls from the top. Seems like most folks try to get into the first area perhaps without knowing about what's ahead so there were fewer people at the top lookout. We were disappointed that inspiration point was closed. It has some amazing views as well. We visited here 25 years ago on our honeymoon - it was definitely worth coming back to see."

The hike to Point Sublime in a nice hike, but the distance on the sign is incorrect, but it is not a hard hike and the views of the gorge are so worth it.\nA piece of advice - Don't forget bug spray, the mosquitos are pretty bad. I do NOT reccomend that you hike to Ribbon Lake!! You will be swarmed by mosquitos (they are not so bad to Point Sublime.) The hike to Ribbon Lake is not really even pretty, through the swamp, pretty much all flat."

The power of these falls is just magnetic. The lookouts are varied and fun. You can ask for specific details from rangers in Canyon Village at the museum and visitor center."

Still this was a great trail and we added a loop to Lily Pad Lake, geothermal area and Clear Lake. Then we drove the North side of canyon stopping at the various short trails and overlooks incredible pictures. Do not miss this"

I said to myself that I would not being having any fun if that was the way I spent my vacation....\nA little planning and preparation will go a long way in Yellowstone."

Hiked from there along the South rim Trail to Uncle Tom's Trail---Then down the stairs to the lookout point---up close and personal with the falls. Very tough down and back up hundreds of steep stairs and back to the parking lot. Went over to the North Rim for trails of the Brink of Upper Falls and Brink of Lower Falls----then on to the North Rim trail through Red Rock (once again very steep down and back up)---then Lookout---Grand View--all giving a different perspective to the falls. Approx. 10 miles total that gave numerous vantage points for view of the falls--even saw Ospreys in a huge nest at top of a rock formation. Start early as these trails get crowded later on----Parking in this area is a challenge--we found it easier to park once on each Rim---and hike all the trails on that side then back to the car. Carry plenty of water and snacks if you choose to combine trails into longer hikes. It limits the need to keep returning to the car for supplies and finding new parking spots.\nGrand Canyon of Yellowstone is a very appropriate name---worth spending an entire day there!!"

This was one of the more crowded places in the park but it was early afternoon so that was expected. If you only have 1 day in the park add this to your list. There is a short hike down to the falls which I was able to do in sandals. My kids raced back up but they are in great shape- may be tough for elderly. There are some places to take a break though."

Uncle Tom's was closed so it was extra crowded at Artist's Point. Brave the traffic jam and you will be rewarded. Parking gets really congested. The earlier you can go, the better. Also, include the scenic drive on your trip. It's worth it. Then stop for a bite at Canyon Lodge. The scenic drive ends next to the entrance."

     "comment": "Based on best 100 hikes in Yellowstone, we were hoping to complete the 3.2 mile shuttle hike from Wapati Lake Trailhead and parking area - just south of Upper Falls on the Yellowstone River, ending at Inspiration Point and including Uncle Tom's Trail.\nThe trail between Wapati Lake and Uncle Tom's Trail is closed. Uncle Tom's Trail is also closed. The car wait to get to Artist Point was at least 30 points, due to high summer traffic. With limited cell phone coverage, it was a bit of a big problem, as signage was very limited as to the closures. Having dropped off our group before taking our cars, we found that the trail was closed, resulted in our party being separated.\nIn the end, we returned on another day, earlier in the morning before the traffic going to Artist Point was so backed up. (We were trying to do this about 11 am on June 30). The ranger later told us that between 9 and 5, the road to Artist Point is at least 30 minute backup.\nThe view is truly spectacular and iconic, so you cannot dismiss it. My best advice, based on other travelers would be to park at Wapati Lake - take the trail to Wapati Lake, then cut over to Uncle Tom's Trail. Find the trail to Artist Point ( the lower 1 mile is open). Unfortunately, you would then need to send someone back (2 miles+) to get a car and wait in line to pick up others.\nIronically, when we did visit the Northern Rim on July 3, there were people on Uncle Tom's Trail and the stairway down to view the Upper Falls. Not sure if it had suddenly opened or more likely - groups were dismissing the \"closed\" signs."

Unfortunately it was one of the last things that we saw so we didn't get to spend as much time here as I would've liked. I would recommend going here early and take your time to go to a couple different vantage points to really appreciate it. I went on the trail that takes you right next to the waterfall and it is just amazing. The trail is a little sketchy but me, my 5 year old and two 7 year olds did pretty good."

Artist point is a precarious hike that parallels the canyon until you get to a set of wooden steps that lead you to the bottom of the falls. Not a great hike for young kids. We also did the Lower Falls hike. It's steep and long but worth it. It takes you to the top of the Falls. There are breathtaking views. There are lots of benches along the hike so you can rest. We were a group of 5 from the ages of 12-65. Loved it. We also checked out the canyon visitor center. Lots of information, flush toilets, and tourist shops/eateries."

Lookout Point and Grand View point gave us great views of the canyon below. Inspiration Point and Inspiration Point road are closed for reconstruction: expect completion in fall 2017.

This area seems to be the most popular in Yellowstone aside from Old Faithful but with about 1/3 the parking - so plan accordingly.\nWe could see people across on North Rim as well - so either way works. We went South Rim because of the easy access to Uncle Tom's Point to overlook the upper falls - then off to Artist Point to overlook the lower falls. A mile long hike beyond took us to Point Sublime and a fantastic overlook with 10% of the crowds. People tend not to venture too far beyond the main areas.\nTo go down into the Canyon area vs. look from the top - there are a lot of stairs - yet this isn't necessary to get the grandeur.\nTo see both stops and take the trails - allow at least 2 hours; probably 3"

And yet we could still feel the mist from the waterfall, and the wind coming off the water and up the canyon walls was strong enough to blow your hat and glasses away. This is a beautiful pull-off in the park. The sound of the rushing water is awe-inspiring. Such raw power!"

There are plenty of access points with good views, however, if you can get away from the crowds on one of the many trails you will be rewarded with truly fantastic views. We walked both the South Rim and the trail to Point Sublime and the views just got better and better. If you intend to visit the park you must include a visit to the Canyon. It is well worth stopping at Canyon Village and the Educational Centre where rangers can give you up to date info on the various trails. You will find their advice very helpful."

Most of the park was un-visitable because of this, or when a parking lot wasn't full/closed, the trail or site was stuffed with throngs of people.\nThis was one of the first sites you come upon if you take the road that loops to the right when you come in. I would have stayed to see it even if there were thirty busses filled with tourists. It is striking and the best thing in the park, in my opinion, unless you get to go off the beaten path and stay (camp out) inside the park away from the crowds,"

View the falls from Look Out Point, Red Rock Point, Artist's Point, & Brink, each offers a different point of view and adds to the experience. Late Spring offered a tremendous amount of water flow and with the snow, made for exquisite photos.\nWe were disappointed we could not go to Inspiration Point, or Uncle Tom's Trail. Artist's Point was our favorite and is an absolute must see."

Walked to Inspiration Point & Artist Point. Views are absolutely gorgeous. There are plenty of great views if you're looking for short, easy walks from the parking lot.\nThere are also fairly short trails to get into the canyon & close to the falls. Those trails have some steep grade and/or lot of steps - somewhere around 120 one way. Uncle Tom's Trail was closed. If you're physically able, it's worth taking the trails."

The canyon, which beautifully frames the Yellowstone River and lower falls can be viewed from above or below. From the upper rim there is a beautiful view of the falls and canyon below and if you're lucky you'll see an Osprey soaring overhead. For those who are able, a 10 minute descent down a winding, somewhat difficult paved trail affords gorgeous views of the canyon and falls close-up. The climb back up to the rim and parking areas is a good 25 minute walk requiring a moderate level of activity. Definitely wear hiking shoes or boots!"

I've read they keep reusing the same nest for years, so I can imagine how long it took to build up to that size.\nWhen we went there was mild snow falling, and there was a rainbow across the Lower Falls. Definitely worth a stop at each of the viewpoints.\nLogistically, we entered from the town of Canyon to the North Rim one way road. There are several places along the road to stop and walk a short distance to an overlook or vista - or you can park and walk along the North Rim Trail, which walks along them, too."

Other two view points take you closer to the water falls but they need effort as you will walk down around almost 200 feet below the rim level. You can hear the roar of the waterfalls and there is a good view of the falls itself.\nIt will take almost one full day to enjoy the beauty from all view points. The best time of the year is June-July or Oct-Nov time frame when the temperature above 50-60 degrees.\nPlease make sure you are wearing sneakers/sport shoes to go the lower view points."

The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is a natural wonder that changes lives every day. It is that special.\nIt is not to be missed during a visit to Yellowstone; especially if it is a once in a lifetime visit for you. Take your time. There are some great hikes at this canyon one might miss, if not made aware. Uncle Tom's Trail will get you a great vantage point of the Lower Falls. Red Rock Point is a trail accessed from Lookout Point. You can get a more direct, straight on view of the Falls from Red Rock Point. It's worth the hike. Both hikes are not too long. But both are steep.\nUncle Tom's Trail has an abundance of steps to conquer. Red Rock trail is steep, but no steps. Have fun!"

     "comment": "In addition to famous and wondrous geothermal features, Yellowstone is also well known for its spectacular canyons and waterfalls. When you visit Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, you can enjoyed not only the beautiful colors of the canyon and its magnificent height but also marvelous sights of the Lower, Upper, and Crystal Falls.\nThere are numerous views of the Falls and Grand Canyon from both the north and south sides of the Grand Canyon, most of which require only a short walk or virtually no walk to see. However, this is one of the most famous spots at the park so during the peak times of the day, it may be hard to find a parking space. It's always wiser to start the day early for the most famous areas of the park or visit them later in the day.\n- From the north side of the canyon: Using the North Rim Drive, you can stop and view the Lower Falls and Grand Canyon of Yellowstone at Inspiration Point, Grand View Point, and Lookout Point. On this side, you can also journey to the top of the falls and feel its extreme power, commanding respect, and intense roar as it drops into the rainbow of mist beneath by hiking down the Brink of the Lower Falls Trail. This is a short 3/4 mile hike but intense with great drop in elevation and a lot of switch backs.\n- From the south side of canyon: Using the South Rim Drive, you can stop and view the Lower Falls and Grand Canyon of Yellowstone at Artists Point. Artists Point is where you can have the most beautiful grand view of the Lower Falls together with Grand Canyon of Yellowstone and the snaking Yellowstone River below. On this side, you can also journey down the Uncle Tom's Trail to have a close-up face off with the electrifying Lower Falls."

Perfect for nature-lovers, national park aficionados, photographers, artists, writers, sightseers, basic tourists, and those who have seen it all. Every perspective is a masterpiece to inspire an artist and to awe any viewer. No wait is needed to see this like Old Faithful, no large crowds at one spot like other geysers, and no need to move around to feel like you have fully experienced it as this canyon feels like every single location is a new experience. The falls, the river, the hikes (both the strenuous and easy ones), and everything in between were some of the best experiences of my life. Even the large stairway to get to the falls isn't enough to hinder my opinion on this wonder of the world."

Don't think about the hike back up. Just know that the views at the bottom are so worth it.\nThis is one of the highlights of Yellowstone, yet one that can be easily missed by those who don't realize how spectacular the Yellowstone River canyon is."

     "comment": "This is more of a review of the park as a whole and covers a variety of sights. Be prepared for a long wait to get into the park if you are visiting in the busy months of July / August. I think we were lined up outside of the park for about 30 mins just trying to get in. This was in the South Entrance. We first went to the West Thumb area where we saw 6 female elks lazing in the grass. There is a walk here which is about 800 meters around the various types of Geysers. Also stop at the Volcano Mud Pools which is pretty interesting. Here we got up close with some Bison that were sunbathing on the path. Then stopped at the Lower and Upper Falls. Not far from here is the \"Grand Canyon of Yellowstone\" which is a large canyon filled with beautiful reds, oranges and browns in colour. Head to Norris Geyser Basin which is a 1.6km round trip with lots of colourful Geysers to look at. Gibbon Falls is a great waterfall if you just want a good view from the parking lot. The Middle Geyser Basin is home to the famous Grand Prismatic Geyser - this is the colourful one always used in the brochures. It is extremely impressive but if the weather is bad or windy you won't see too much. We had a lot of steam and wind and really couldn't see too much. We had to wait for a break in the wind before we saw the colours.\nOne thing to note is that the parking in the park in summer is ridiculous. There are not enough car park spaces for the large amount of tourists especially in summer so you will end up parked on the side of the road and walk in. Be mindful do not park in spaces that say no parking. We did see people checking parked cars and writing out tickets.\nOverall the park is just amazing. It is mostly all about wildlife and geysers so if you like them then you will have a blast. Try and go in either May or late August early September to avoid the traffic madness."

We hiked both the Lower Falls Brink Trail (3/8 mi. and 600 foot drop) and the Uncle Tom's Trail (328 steps down in the canyon for a beautiful view of the Lower Falls), and although both trails were steep, they were both worth it! We also stayed at the new Canyon Hotel, and everything was brand new and lovely. We walked over to the cafeteria for breakfast, which was nice because it was quick, cheap, and had good options. We liked staying in the Canyon Area because of it's central location ... we would stay here again. We liked that it was less crowded than either the Old Faithful or Mammoth areas, and yet we could easily drive to both locations."

     "comment": "Yellowstone National Park holds beautiful and untouched land of the United States. My family and friends took part in the Yellowstone Lower Loop full day tour, stopping at many attractions. On the tour, we went to Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Grand Prismatic Spring, and Firehole Canyon. Yellowstone opened my eyes to how beautiful the natural world is.\nOne of the places we went was the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The tour bus stopped at the entrance, so we could hike to the canyon. Our tour guide informed us about the area of Yellowstone and the wildlife it contained. On the journey to the canyon, I saw lots of wildlife I hadn’t seen before. The wild animals were ginormous and fascinating. The canyon was astonishing. Canyons and mountains surrounded a giant waterfall and a blue river. Looking around, I saw the most beautiful picture of the earth and wildlife engulfing me. Until I went to the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, I never realized how big the world was compared to the small town I live in.\nIn Yellowstone, the tour took us to the Grand Prismatic Spring. The hike to the spring was enjoyable because there were small hot springs all around that you could look into. It was important to stay on the path so we didn’t disturb wildlife or accidentally step in a boiling spring. After being amazed by the hot springs on the way, my mind was blown when I finally reached Grand Prismatic. In order to get a view of the entire spring, we had to climb a hill that looks onto it. The vibrant colors of Grand Prismatic make it a must see. Blue, red, orange, and pink filled the steaming water below us. Grand Prismatic is the most fascinating sight I have ever seen. I had no idea the world contained such breathtaking features.\nThe excursion to Firehole Canyon was my favorite adventure during the Yellowstone tour. Firehole Canyon is a beautiful canyon connected to the Firehole River. Part of the canyon consisted of still, warm water that we got to relax in. The water was the perfect temperature for swimming because the river is connected to various hot springs in Yellowstone. It was very peaceful relaxing on the rocks in the water and looking around at the beautiful cliffs and mountains surrounding me. Firehole Canyon also has an area with cliffs and rapids. It was exhilarating to jump off of the cliffs and into the rapids. My friends and I spent hours flinging ourselves into the fast-moving rapids. We had a lot of fun at Firehole Canyon, while still enjoying beautiful scenery.\nYellowstone National Park opened my eyes to a world outside of the city. I recommend going on the Yellowstone tour to enjoy beautiful scenery and wildlife. The tour provided lots of information and fun as we traveled through the park. Taking part in the Yellowstone tour allowed to me to experience and see sights that were once unknown to me."

     "comment": "When I heard of Grand Canyon, I only thought of the one, you know, the GRAND CANYON in Arizona. I didn't know there was one in Yellowstone. When I reached around 4pm. Damn, was I delightfully surprised. You could hear the roar of the tall waterfall. I think there was a path to go near it, but I didn't go down. I stayed on the safer and higher side of the canyon.\nThe path were well-paved, it ain't muddy nor rocky, quite feet-friendly, most of the path were wheelchair friendly too. Looking across the canyon was nothing very spectacular. The best part was looking down into the canyon. The sunlight, on that day, was bright and brought out the contrast of the rugged surface of the cliffs. The colours of the canyon walls and the blue water of the river was beautiful without photoshop.\nI believe the trek can go on and on and on, I didn't venture too far. I do see there are people across the canyon on the other side. So, you probably could spend a good half a day if you are into photography. If not, just 40min - 1hr is a pretty comfortable time.\nOh, we got a bonus to see a hawk chasing off a raven which flew too near to its nest."

It was way more impressive than I was thinking in the build up to the visit. It is worth seeing from both sides - each offer very different worthwhile experiences. Get up close with the waterfall. The volume of water (both in terms of the capacity and the noise) is extraordinary. Quite a lot of descending to do in both cases, and therefore the return ascent - so bear that in mind before heading down. Wonderful."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was one of my favorite stops in the park. There is so much great hiking around the rim offering breathtaking views. Some of the trails were closed for the season by the time we got there in mid september, but there were so many other trails open, it didn't matter.\nIf you are going to hike (and I mean really hike, not stopping where the sidewalk ends) the trails, just like everywhere in Yellowstone, be prepared! Have water and bear spray. Try to go in groups and talk loudly to scare off any bears or other wildlife that may be near by. While we didn't see any bears, we saw plenty of things that let us know they were nearby (... big piles of fresh poo...). I don't say that to scare anyone off from hiking. Just be prepared so you can enjoy it!\nThe steps down to the waterfall are hard, but so worth it! Please seriously consider if you think you are up for it. I am pretty fit and still had to stop coming back up. There are benches in different spots along the way for you to stop and rest. Also consider if you are ok with open heights. The steps are see through and can be a little unnerving if you don't like heights.\nThere was a good amount of parking. But again, we were there mid September. I've heard horror stories about the summer."

You will just keep on looking at the falls and the valley and will have little time to talk with your party. The beauty of nature will engulf you in silence.\nas you go down the stairs the falls look different. As you hike along the rim, each vista point will give you a different view and perspective. You will also hike between some geothermal area which is kind of neat.\nOverall a great hike and great views."

This was our 3rd trip to Yellowstone & we came here all 3 times.\nCanyons is a very busy place. I would recommend the same advice I give to everyone : when visiting a busy national park GET UP EARLY!! Shower the night before. Eat a light breakfast (not in a restaurant) & get over there!! In the summer this place is jump'in.\nThere are 2 main areas. The North Rim & South Rim. Both are equally beautiful, but due to construction, we've spent more time at the South Rim. The parking area in the South Rim is huge. The view of the Lower Falls spectacular. There's a few day hikes you can access at this point. The Canyon Rim South Trail is 3.5 miles one way, but fantastic views can be seen at many points on the trail. Walk a little way & then go back when you get tired.\nThe North Rim parking is a problem. If you go later in the day, you will have stress. This road is one way traffic only. Inspiration Point is a highlight. There's also the North Rim Trail, which is 3 miles one way. There's also a lot of great views.\nCanyons has a large shopping area, with restaurants, the General Store, an outdoor outfitter & the Visitor Center. There's also a campground with laundry & showers."

The bare rocks of the Yellowstone \"grand\" Canyon are truly golden yellow, (and in places even tangerine orange and russet red), hence \"Yellow stone\". We walked to a viewpoint along the Uncle Tom's Cabin Trail, and could see the Yellowstone River clearly as it pelted over a steep precipice and into the gorge below. We followed the trail down a winding track, the air scented with pine resin, almost to the base of the falls. After a mile or so, the path stopped abruptly, 380 steps on several steel connected platforms took us to the valley floor, where the spray creates misty rainbows. Not suitable for anyone with vertigo."

The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is so amazing. You only have to let your imagination go and you will realize how incredible our world really is. Norris Geysers are so amazing also. You will do some walking but so worth it! Just think that you are walking on the boardwalks above the worlds larger volcano!!! Think about that for a minute....must put it on your bucket list!"

There were significant crowds that summer Thursday braving the somewhat steep and windy trails down then back up again. The platforms at the base by the waterfall revealed the expansive views of the canyon valley stretching for miles. There is another viewing platform on the other side that is accessed through another vantage point. It was good for a little while to get outside and see some awesome scenery."

You can just walk out to the overlooks or go for a full on walk around the rims. Would recommend that you build in plenty of time here to take in all the sites and go for longer hikes to get all the views, There are plenty of parking spots, but most of the hiking is out and back, as there are no shuttles. The scenery is absolutely stunning, in anyone's language. The North rim is a one way road, back to Canyon Village. Do not overlook the Brink of the falls walks."

It is truly amazing.\nHint2: Don't worry about the crowds. There are many areas with easy access and fences that tend to be a bit crowded, but people move on and you will get to the front to see the views.\nHint3: To avoid the crowds, hit the paths. There are many uncrowded paths where you can walk right up to the edge of a cliff and look down without any fence or barrier. Everywhere you go and look, the views are unbelievable.\nHint4: Take a ton of pictures, but don’t expect them to replicate the beauty and depth of the canyon. Looking at the photos and videos I took, the videos do a much better job of capturing the depth, color and size of the area."

We went to the south rim. When you enter the road to view the canyon you are now on a one way loop road that takes you back to the Canyon Village area. Be sure to look for the stairway on the opposite side that goes half way down the rock face to a small platform. Only for the brave! Also look for the lower falls. Stunning!"

     "comment": "Been here three times from SoCal. One time for myself and twice more as a family guide. I enjoyed Yellowstone more than Yosemite, Grand Canyon or even Rocky Mountain although they have less visitors. Might be due to it's location. Simply driving thru the \"number 8\" shape scenic loop gave me lot of fun. It's a huge park. All three times I visited, I entered the park at 8am and finished the complete loop at around 6 or 7pm depends on the traffic. I took almost all small roads where car can enter thru. I like this park because I don't have to walk too far too see things. So it's great place like myself who hates walking too much during the vacation (I take vacation to relax). Most of the viewing can be done from inside the car or by very short walk. Be forewarn that this park has lot of Park Ranger action compare to other parks. I never seen so many visitors get pulled over(assuming speeding) like in this park. They come out from nowhere like the highway patrols. If you're there for just one day, then do the counter-clock drive. It's a better side for viewing and entering view points. If you begin before 8am you should be able to view all the popular attractions and finish the \"8\" loop by 7pm. If you're lucky you'll catch Old Faithful eruption as well. At one visit I tried to complete full loop and reverse back loop in one day but couldn't unless I'm the only one in the park, and without speed limit. You will definitely see Bisons but I noticed huge number of them come out on the road just before sunset when most visitors are gone. And lastly, don't make a mistake of not visiting Grand Teton National Park right below the Yellowstone."

We walked down to the rim of the lower falls which is 3/8 of a mile with about 10 switchbacks on the trail . The walk down was strenuous for me because of physical limitations , but it was worth it . The view at the bottom is awesome . The walk up was harder on my lungs but easier on my body . Do this walk if you have the chance . The canyon is truly wonderful . There are several spots to see the falls, upper and lower , and to enjoy the beauty of this canyon . Loved it !"

Seems that the land just lifts up impressively from the basin to the elevated hill, forming the canyon with Yellowstone river inside and the scenic views as well. It'a wonderful place to view the waterfall from the viewing deck on the top. BTW, Yellowstone River flows to the north and will merge to Madison river in Montana, then join Missouri River and Mississippi River in Missouri. So considered by the length, Yellowstone or Madison River is one of the fountainheads of Mississippi River."

The upper falls viewpoint is distant, but a level hike of approximately 1 mile takes you to a much more interesting viewpoint.\nA hike with a drop of 600 feet takes you to the top of the lower falls from this viewpoint, where you can stand on the lip of the lower falls,\nThe lower falls are by far the more impressive, being the iconic picture of the Yellowstone river.\nThe lower falls viewpoint gives an excellent view of the lower falls with minimal walking.\nThe great loop road tends to be extremely congested and parking can be a hassle, but the views are worth the effort."

     "comment": "Breathtaking and accessible thanks to the Parks peopl'e. Every stop on the road is little or no hiking to a great viewpoint. Off the main road you can choose to take the South loop of North loop. If you only take one take the South loop as it takes in Uncle Tom's Trail and Artist Point. Note the North loop becomes a one way loop that heads into the Canyon Lodge area which is convenient if you are staying there. Do not violate the rules of staying on the trails or viewing viewing area fencing. It is enticing but people have died in these areas that are very safe. Go early to get better vibes and easier picture taking as when the tour buses arrive it sort of disturbs the pleasure a bit. Note that Uncle Tom's trail can scare people because of the alerts of the 358 or so steps can be exhausting, it is not as bad as it sounds, so go ahead it is worth it, just take your time."

The parking isn't as bad here as other places, but because of the tour buses stopping here, the crowds will be bigger. That isn't bad though it will be a multicultural event with everyone asking to have their picture taken with the waterfall and river back ground in all kinds of different languages. Mostly lots of pointing and hand waving trying to communicate with each other. We really had a great time in the crowds and after they dispersed we did some of the hikes and enjoyed getting up and close to some of the water features down in the canyon it self. All we spent more time here than any place else at YNP.\nThe Good: wonderful views of the canyon with an impressive water fall flowing into a striking blue river.\nThe Bad: Should have spent more time here than other places in the park\nThe ugly: Parking can be \"interesting\" in peak crowds\nOn the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10, I give this canyon 8 bubbles"

Decided to back-track to after heading down to Old Faithful in the morning and we are glad we did. Was well worth the additional time it took.\nWatch the signs and be aware that the best views of the \"brink\" of the falls are from the first parking lot you pull in to. We had to circle around the loop twice because we missed the signs that are immediately on the right as you pull in to the upper lot. Once you arrive in the lot there are a lot of overlooks and trails that offer various angles of the canyon and falls. A thorough visit can be accomplished in 1.5 - 2 hours.\nTake good shoes and a good camera!"

Uncle toms trail is a tough 329 step hike down to the bottom. It's a pretty strenuous climb but well worth it and there is no reason that you have to go fast so we'd recommend it to anyone without a health reason to not make the climb (my wife and I made the hike with our 1 and 3 yr olds on our backs)."

     "comment": "This was our second trip to Yellowstone so we skipped Old Faithful. We came in the north entrance (wonderful stone arch dedicated to Teddy Roosevelt) after staying overnight in Bozeman. BTW, if you are over 65, buy a Senior pass: free admittance to all national parks. You get your $10 back in one visit.\n. We wanted to see the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone so we turned east at Mammoth Springs (what wonderful old buildings!). We picked the lower falls - the views are all along the rim. To see the best view of the falls, try the wooden walkway down into the canyon. It is a spectacular canyon! Then we drove over to Norton Basin (stopping for a picnic at the Virginia Cascades - picnic tables at the end of the loop). The Basin has a nice museum and several walks through the geysers. Fascinating!\nTo leave the park through the east entrance, you drive by the immense Lake Yellowstone. It's a long way to Cody (30 minutes to the East entrance, 50 more to Cody) but the canyon on the way is beautiful.\nWe came back into the park the next day and left by the south entrance, right into the Tejons NP. Be sure to keep your entry receipt or have that Senior pass ready.\nFYI. Gas is available all over the park. Take a picnic so you can skip the Grills and restaurants that are filled by buses. Picnic tables everywhere and in beautiful areas."

     "comment": "Located in the center of Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is, in my opinion, the best attraction in the park. It is a short drive south of the Canyon Village & Visitor Center. We went to both the north and south rims - to get a different view of the canyon and the falls. The \"Lookout Point\" on the north rim gives you a closer look at the lower fall. The \"Artist Point\" on the south rim give you a more complete impression of the canyon; it is one of the most popular spots to take pictures. I highly recommend visiting both rims but keep in mind that the north rim road is a one-way road and you will end up going back to the Canyon Village.\nYou can also take one of the trails to go down to the bottom of the lower fall but there are a lot of stairs to climb; it is not recommended if you don't have much time."

No matter what side of the canyon you see this place it is amazing with lots of viewing areas which you can walk or drive too. There are limited parking at some viewing areas so patience or walking will be the solution."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is twenty miles long. The canyon is up to 4,000-feet wide and 1,200-feet deep in places. From several vantage points, you can view Lower Falls plunging steeply into the canyon 308 feet, or the Upper Falls tumbling 109 feet. The various yellow, red, pink, and white mineral stains mark the locations of hot springs and steam vents in the canyon walls. \"Most of the yellows in the canyon are the result of iron present in the rock rather than sulfur, as many people think.\"\nWe enjoyed the beauty of this easy stop, however, we did not enjoy the large crowds. Many recommend going early if you can but if you are driving the loop and not staying in the park then that is hard. The beauty is worth the hassle of fellow tourists. ;) It was quite an unexpected sight in YNP compared to all the thermal attractions."

We spent about three hours visiting the different points to view the Upper and Lower Falls. We did not take Uncle Tom's Trail, but stopped at the Brink of the Upper and Lower Falls, Artists Point, and a couple more places along the North Rim Drive. The different views of the falls are spectacular. We especially enjoyed Artists Point and the Brink of the Upper Falls....you are standing directly over the falls and the noise of the rushing water is awesome. My husband in unable to walk long distances or inclines and he was able to walk to both brinks as well as Artists Point without any difficulty."

I was nervous for families with young children that did not seem to understand the perils of falling into the canyon if they did not keep their children close at hand!

There are benches to sit / rest if needed and the steps are wide enough to accommodate foot traffic coming and going in either direction. Once at the bottom there is a nice landing and an awesome view of the lower falls. The upper falls trail is very easy to access and also provides excellent views. A short distance from this access point is a stop called artist point, make sure to see this , all of Yellowstone is breathtaking , it allows you to see the lower falls as it cascades into the steep canyon below . This is a must see."

Depending on where you come in from (either Grand Loop from the south or north, or Norris Canyon Rd. from the west) you will hit either North Rim or South Rim drives first.\nThe South Rim Drive will take you to Uncle Tom's trail, a short and easily accessible trail that follows along the canyon and to Artist's Point, which is easily one of my favorite sights.\nNorth Rim Drive is a loop from Canyon Village south to Grand Loop Rd near the South Rim Drive and has view access of its own to the brink of both falls and to Inspiration Point (which sadly was closed when we drove through).\nOverall it was a great experience (although not very child-friendly) in Yellowstone!"

That early in the day, you'll see mule deer, porcupines, etc. Also, the parking lots will be empty, the construction zones will be down, and the roads will be free of traffic. Additionally, it will be cool. The downside is that the cool air makes the steam more visible, which obstructs the view of the thermal features.\nThe park has clearly marked trails and a wide variety of land types: volcanic geysers/pools, grasslands, mountains, rivers, canyons, waterfalls etc. I highly recommend Uncle Tom's hike."

What with all the park visitors crowding around, plus global warming and pine beetle damage, I figured the view couldn't be as beautiful and the trees would be gone. I am not pessimistic; I just assumed he made it more vibrant than it was in reality.\nWow, was I wrong, and so happy to be wrong! This place is as lovely to see as any place I have been. The water is like green glass, the canyon walls are subtle pastels, the trees are deep green, and all I have is this camera. Sigh...next time I'm bringing my paintbox."

From the rush of water on the Lower Falls, to the mists rising at it hits canyon bottom. The color of the walls, a soft, creamy ecru often shot through with red, to the blue of the river running below. It really is breath taking. I did not make the trek down to the falls viewing platforms but from what I understand it is relatively easy. Check with the rangers to be sure. I did go over to the South Rim. The view of the Lower Falls is much better from the observation points."

     "comment": "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is absolutely stunning, featuring a waterfall at the top, forests on either side, and colorful cliffs. I recommend the South Rim Trail along the south rim of the canyon for the best overall views -- you get great views of the falls and multiple overlooks of the canyon. You could start at Uncle Tom's Trail and climb down the 380 steps if you want, but the views from the trail were just as good in my opinion and far less busy. The east end of the South Rim Trail is Artist's Overlook (also packed with tourists), so the walk along the way between Uncle's Tom's Trail and Artist's Overlook is probably the best way to get all of the views with less foot traffic around you."

     "comment": "We drove all the way from Denver, Colo and arrived late night in Cody at a pre- booked lodge.The views on the way was Great.Next morning set out for the Yellowstone National Park.Outside temperature was cold,but our expectations were immense, every now & then forcing us out of the car to breathe freshest of airs & admire the Lake, faraway snow clad mountains and try to locate a Bear on Ground. Wild life abounds, road side warnings do prepare you for this. This being a volcanic region, Sulphur springs abound and well marked places are to be trekked to Enjoy oneself. Mid morning saw us eagerly waiting for Eruptions of the Old Faithful,(largest of the Geysers) which does so with clockwork precision. Crowd's anticipation is fully justified & cheering on seeing the Geyser can only be explained as ecstatic. A sprawling Log Cabin(claimed to be largest of its kind in Northern America) serves people with Good Food, lodging & Greatest of the views. A Great Water Fall & Rhyolite mountain takes up your afternoon. You can drive around a number of places stopping by to admire Nature at its Best. We chose to drive back to Jackson for the Night. Setting sun behind the Grand Tetons Range offers magnificent vista to record and savour later with Wine & Dinner. Plan for at least two nights stay, you will not be disappointed. Love to go back."

National Parks need to consider queues for viewing points......with say a maximum stay of 20 seconds before you need to move on.\nWon't say two days in the park were wasted, but definitely an anticlimax."

Take the Upper Rim road and the Lower Rim road. Stop at all the turnouts, because each gives you a different view of the canyon, river and falls. Do some hiking, but be sure to educate yourself about the trails - some have large elevation changes - easy going down, but difficult going back up. This is one of the must-do features of Yellowstone."

I have seen bears, deer, wolves, otters but on previous visits, this trip we only saw a raven in one of the badly organised car parks.\nIt is a beautiful place but don't go in July or August is my recommendation. We had a day long traffic jam which is miserable especially when ones expectations (based on previous trips) are so high and hoping to see an abundance of wildlife. There is nothing wrong with Yellowstone but if you wish to watch Old Faithful along with several thousand other folks the go in July or August. Last time I saw Old Faithful I was there in June and saw it blow with maybe one hundred people also watching. Sadly a forgettable experience for us this time around, I will be back but not in July or August, our experience was quite horrid unless you like sitting in heavy traffic on your vacation, if this is your taste head to Yellowstone today, you wont be disappointed."

However, among canyons and waterfalls, we have seen others similar, so this was not one of our favorite areas of Yellowstone. Artists Point and Inspiration Point are worth a stop if you are in the area. Did not care for the hikes to the brinks of the two falls. Not a good spot for viewing and appreciating the falls. Having visited Grand Canyon NP 3 years ago, any place using those two words in its title is stretching it. The canyon is impressive--and the only one of its kind in Yellowstone--but we would not describe it as 'grand.'"

You can get to either side of the canyon; you can view it from top level overlooks; or you can take paths down into the canyon to view the waterfalls etc. more closely. We stuck to the overlooks and the epic views they provided. The trails down look to be fun and allow for close up, or a different angled view from down inside the canyon. Some trails don't go down to the falls, some are farther down the canyon and just provide a different perspective. They are not for the out of shape or injured, as they are very steep and long windy paths. However, they provide amazing views for those who wish to take them. That said, you do not need to in order to enjoy this magnificent area of the park. The overlooks provide full views of it all, and from multiple overlook locations to provide different views and angles. It's a definite must see for any first time visit."

However, we ensured that we reached Artist's point on the lower rim as early in the day as possible. Wise decision. especially on the weekend.\nThe stunning views of the lower water falls, the \"painted\" valleys with bright colors from oxidized metals, the blue sky, the green vegetation, around the water is a perfect place for photographs. However, everyone who comes there has the same idea. The area where one can take pictures or view the scenery is limited and thus potential to create congestion. Thus, we started from here and went to the north rim later on.\nIt is difficult to explain the beauty in words. Thus, you have to see it!!\nmust see!!!"

The Yellowstone River was turquoise blue and wove through the canyon with very high walls of many colors like yellow, coral, pink! We took the South Rim trail and it was easy with some hilly paths. There are numerous overlooks and any one of them is just amazingly beautiful. We hiked to Artists Point and there's a wonderful lookout area there where you can see the canyon in both directions and the Lower Falls. The Lower Falls are super cool with the green color that is in the water at the top! Never saw that before! We hiked down the North Rim to the Lower Falls overlook where you are right at the top of those falls and it's breathtaking! That was somewhat strenuous getting down and then back up but well worth it. Take your time and stop and rest! We saw a momma black bear and two cubs out in a field just before stopping at the North Rim too! Highly recommend seeing Yellowstone's GRAND Canyon!"

We did not hike along the trail but rather drove from overlook to overlook. The views were absolutely beautiful and well worth it. Some of the areas made us nervous with our kids. I read on another post that the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone has the most beautiful views in all of Yellowstone, and I think I would have to agree with that."

The different minerals mixed with the water and scenery in the background just makes you want to pause..... and take in a few moments.\nYou really will want to spend enough time to make a beautiful memory.\nJust keep a close eye on the little one's since it is a very deep canyon with lots of people.\nSchedule a stop and enjoy you will be glad you did."

And going up is not as easy as it would be at sea level! Just saying...even those in great shape will be huffing and puffing at the top of the climb.

     "comment": "One of the most beautiful things to see and do in Yellowstone. We spent one day hiking, climbing up and climbing down to see the falls from each viewing point. It is so gorgeous. The \"artist point\" is the easiest hike and very dramatic view. The \"Uncle Tom's Trail\" is a lot of overhead and a lot of stairs. The view is nice but the standing area at the base of the trail is small and as soon as you get down there, you feel pressure to leave because there isn't enough room for a lot of people to stand around there resting. The North Rim Trail was the most worth-it in my opinion as it is not a strenuous trail to the falls or back, it is a series of ramps instead of stairs and the view is unreal. Hiking around the falls is fun, great exercise and the views are not-to-be-missed. Bring your camera, good sneakers or trail shoes, a hat and some water."

Best to get out there early as it gets packed quickly. If you want to get pictures (like panoramas) without others in your pics you will need to be there by 9am. Parking was the best here versus anywhere else in the park but again we were there early. The views were spectacular! Worth the walk down to Artist Point and at the Brink of Upper Falls. We did not do Uncle Tom's Trail as we could see lots from the smaller walks. We are glad we didn't as we saw a lot of people struggling back up the stairs (you get a good view point of the trail from the Brink). Lookout Point and Grand View are also good places to stop as they give great views of the canyon below. Inspiration Point is closed until 2018 for renovations."

And then we drove to the upper falls. We took a trail called 'Uncle Tom's Trail' that consisted of 328 steps down towards the base of the falls. The steps are broken up by paths. It takes quite a while to navigate. The steps are metal and steep. At times, I was holding onto the railing with both hands. At the bottom is a platform with a bench. There are also some benches along the way. There was a bit of a line leading to the platform. You can take some great photos. It was tough walking back up but it was definitely worth it."

Each vantage point offers different viewing opportunities, and many of them let you see other viewpoints, including ones you were just at less than half an hour ago."

If you're not faint of heart it is a little scary walking down the stairs that lead down to the platform 328 steps in all. Just remember you have to climb out. The south rim trail hije is a beautiful mix of meadows, cliff views, geysers and the stairs. You can choose to view the waterfall from Artisans point or do the stairs we chose both and we were amazed at the beauty. We did not see any bears on this hike, however we did see fresh claw marks on the trees. Bring bear spray you can purchase or rent the spray. A must do hike."

     "comment": "We spent three days around the park, and I recommend staying at the park that length to appreciate it without being hurried. The park staff kept the roads clear and accessible, and all the attractions and signs were well marked. the mas and signage were always up to date, and the speed recommendations were quite appropriate. I would recommend that the park should put marked speed bumps warning bumps before the worst curves, but only a negligent driver could have ignored the signs. Be advised: most cell reception falls apart within the park. We stopped at numerous roadside attractions and viewed many geysers. The signage and staff explained in detail science (geology and geography). As standalones, the sites viewing some waterfalls and hillsides are not fully accessible, and had not apparent features for readers needing assistance (poor mobility, blindness). We strongly recommend the Boiling River Spa, even with its limited accessibility. We were pleasantly surprised by the accessibility and proximity to certain wild animals (bison/female moose), although the bears, bighorn sheep, and male moose were conspicuously; absent. I recommend wearing hats in July, and to keep a camera ready as wildlife appear a lot closer to the human activity than expected."

It is simply everywhere.\nThis place offers a breath taking view deep into earth with a roaring river for a back drop. There are multiple places to view this and I would recommend the south rim parking area and a walk east off the asphalt and away from the crowds. There is a great trail that goes to Ribbon Lake that follows the rim for about .5 mile. I would recommend that. For sure\nMy biggest complaint was crowds. We spent a total of 4 days in Yellowstone and two places were crowded beyond my comfort were the South Rim parking lot and Old Faithful. Try to get away from the crowds and enjoy that absolute gift from God."

     "comment": "If you go to the park without seeing the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, then you haven't really been to Yellowstone. This place is breath taking, and you will never tire of visiting or looking at this majestic place. There are two waterfalls that empty in to the awe inspiring canyon - Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone. You can walk (trails) to both of these falls, and you must DO this. In fact, there are several other places along the canyon that are famous for viewing the canyon. In addition to the falls, make sure you take Uncle Tom's Trails (really a stair case that goes in to the canyon), and Artist Point and Inspiration Point. I encourage you to visit these points before 9:30 am or after 5 pm to avoid the tour buses that will dump large numbers of people at once making it difficult to take photos of the beautiful scenery. Carry water with you at all times. There are also plenty of restrooms around most of these points. In fact, there is a large, modern restroom facility before you take Uncle Tom's Trail. We stayed at the Canyon Lodge (we loved it) and visited the canyon every day for four days. We never tired of it."

Decide which stop is the most interesting and make that your starting point. Do everything including any hiking that can take you a half mile from the parking lot. You will shed people like a mink coat.\nThe South Rim is less populated with fewer stops. It offers every bit as much amazing stuff as the North Rim just fewer places to check it out.\nPlan a full day in the Canyon area. Don't miss the soda counter in the General Store in the Canyon developed area. Its a so fun 50s authentic experience (except for the prices and the \"earth friendly\" throw away serving \"dishes\")."

If you hike down a bit, you get a better view of the falls. There are at least two type of viewing platforms. There were also some trails that would allow more hiking along the river. We did not have time to explore these but they looked pretty cool. If you come to the park, this is a must-see."

     "comment": "People sometimes ask me, why is Yellowstone called that way. Are stones yellow there? Having been to Yellowstone several times before, but never visited the Grand Canyon area, I always just said that I had no idea.\nWell, now that I've been there, I can say that the cliffs in this area is indeed yellow, and perhaps that's why the river and park are named that way?\nThere are roads and view points that line both side of the canyon. There are several water falls, but due to geography, you can't see more than one fall from a single view point. Some view points also require slight hikes, so plan accordingly.\nWe didn't go to the north side this time. But I must say that the lower fall is a lot prettier, and you must visit Artist Point if you don't mind walking a little bit. The views are awesome, and worth the effort.\nIt's not as deep or expansive as Grand Canyon N.P., but the canyon itself is nevertheless quite pretty. As I mentioned, the yellow-colored cliff is something unique.\nDefinitely worth a stop here."

If you only see them from one spot, this is the one to do it in.\nThere is plenty of parking, and it is a short walk to the falls. There are stairs, and I don't remember if there is a ramp for wheelchairs or not."

Afterwards, we did the South rim. Old Faithful is nice, but, the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone needs equal billing."

Even with mist and rain and strong wind, we would have gone back a third time if we thought we would finally have had some sunshine. As an amateur artist, I really appreciated the colors of the canyon walls. And I finally understood why it is called Yellowstone. As with most spots in the park, parking is a little bit of a problem. (Of course, since it was misting/raining, it was not much of a problem the days we were actually there.) So after seeing Old Faithful, this is the next \"must see,\" and you will probably enjoy it even more than Old Faithful because it doesn't go away for an hour and a half!"

     "comment": "There are some trails from both North and South Rim Drives. It is nice to try all those trails. But if your time is limited, I recommend the South Rim Drive trails. It is a 2-mile round trip, from Uncle Tom's Trail to Artist Point. The best time to avoid the crowd is the morning before 10:00am or the late afternoon."
