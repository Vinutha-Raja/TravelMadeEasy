We stopped off on the side of the road at a little parking area. We could hear water flowing so we hiked the trail until we found a gorgeous creek with flowing water. We sat there taking in the fresh air, beautiful weather and enjoyed a snack. Traffic was a little congested heading to Alta, so we turned around and headed back. Still worth the trip."

     "comment": "Little Cottonwood Canyon is one of the three main routes up to Salt Lake City's famous Ski areas. All three routes offer spectacular views. Little Cottonwood Canyon is an eight-mile drive that ends in the old mining town/now ski resort town of Alta. If the steep granite walls didn't clue you in, the heavily bunkered resort buildings and periodic gates and avalanche warning signs would tell you that this drive is not one to be taken lightly in the winter. But in the fall, the foliage is absolutely gorgeous, especially in contrast to the granite. If you want to get out and walk, there is Temple Quarry Trail at the mouth of the canyon. Just keep in mind that there are no dogs allowed anywhere in the canyon (to protect the watershed). Alta itself is a bit of a disappointment as a town, as there is really nothing there except the resort. But as a little getaway to nature that is just minutes away from Salt Lake City, it is definitely worth a visit."

     "comment": "On our last trip to Salt Lake, my wife and I had about an hour or so of free time, so we decided to take a drive up the canyon. The road ends at Alta ski resort, so you'll need to turn around and go back to where you came from. Other canyons we have seen actually connect to roads on the other side - such as the drive up to Park City, for example. However, this probably means there are fewer cars along your way.\nThe scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. I'm sure it would be pretty dangerous during the winter months with snow and ice everywhere, but if you are here during the summer months, you have plenty of wonderful scenery to enjoy. Along the way, there are several places to stop and take pictures or just enjoy the view.\nThe drive up to the top of the road does not take very long - it's only about 9 miles or so from the base of the canyon to Alta. But it also means you can see the entire canyon quickly.\nIf you love the outdoors, you would love to make this drive."

     "comment": "Visiting family in Salt Lake City, our daughter took us up to Albion Basin in Little Cottonwood Canyon to see the wild flowers. Although mid-July may be a couple weeks before peak season, the hike up the path to the mountain lake was quite spectacular. It's the perfect place to escape the 90+ degree temps down in the City with a breezy mid-70's temperature to enjoy while climbing the trail. There is no shortage of wildflowers in all directions, as well as leftover snow pack in many places. The canyon in the winter is prime skiing area, so there are chairlift towers around, but not enough to diminish the enjoyment of the scenery. There are bathroom facilities by the main parking lot at the trail head. Parking can be a bit hard to find. The volunteers on the roadway will encourage you to park well below the trail and take a tram up to the final parking area, but we took the risk and were rewarded with a newly vacated spot. There are also a few turn-outs along the drive up that offer spaces for 3-5 cars, so it is possible to park short of the trail head and hike the road a ways. We noticed quite a number of couple with very young children in backpacks because the climb is only moderately demanding. Note, that the elevation in the canyon is over 9,000 above sea level, so if you are from a much lower altitude, you may possibly get a bit more winded than you might expect."

It's very easy to get there and it's not as crowded as Park City and some of the other scenic drives in Utah.\nIt's definitely my favorite drive in the fall. When the leaves are changing, it's an amazing drive. It's also got some nice hiking trails for the summer months. It's a nice break in the summer from the heat in the valley. The trees always smell amazing and there's usually a nice breeze.\nI love this canyon and wish I could go back more often."

     "comment": "One of the top 5 scenic drives within 30min of a major airport in the US, maybe the best. Glaciated, U-shaped canyon. Mountains rise 7,000 ft over Salt Lake valley floor. Tram ride at Snowbird is amongst the most scenic trams/gondolas in US, and new restaurant at top is an outstanding place to have a bit to eat, soak up sun and chew on God's scenery. Caution that if snowy, won't see much and road requires chains and/or 4WD with significant fine if you get stuck b/c you drove up with bad equipment (rent the right car at airport if winter). NO dogs allowed including in car (another min. $125.00 fine). Numerous excellent hikes in the canyon, but none are truly easy. Pretty much all are at least intermediate if not hard. 2 ski resorts, Alta, Snowbird are world class skiing, although Alta isn't world class hotels/amenities (people ski here, so this isn't peopled by boards of monied folks.) Enjoy it!"

A couple nice campgrounds up there- and a huge ski resort complex. In Alta, free info is handed out for area hikes.\nWe drove past the resorts, up the steep road, past where the road becomes gravel. The hike we chose took us to an alpine lake 1 mile away, then we struggled up further to the top of a mountain peak. Saw 4 moose, marmots, great views...totally peaceful and cool."

Many people hike up to the top of the peaks and ski/board down outside of the resorts. Hiking is another activity that is widely done in the canyon also. There are several condo's and house for rent and the Alta shuttle makes it easy to get to the slopes and back home with little trouble. We stayed at HellsGate Condo unit \"J\" and the views were fabulous. The condo was nice and well equipped. I would highly recommend Little Cottonwood Canyon to experience Alta/Snowbird and the views!"

There are many hiking trails of varying difficulties, 2 ski resorts ( Snowbird & Alta), camping and picnic areas, a creek and the town of Alta at the top of the canyon. If you have a 4 x4, you can keep going at the top and take the dirt road over Guardsman Pass and end up in the Heber Valley. We love to cross country ski along the Quarry trail during the winter. A beautiful glacier-made canyon!"

     "comment": "A short drive from most homes in Salt Lake City, Little Cottonwood is a year-round outdoor playground. World class skiing is a given. However, when the snow melts those same slopes and peaks offer top notch mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, etc. It's also at least ten degrees cooler than the valley in the summertime and offers clean air during the conversion months that make the valley so uncomfortable to be outdoors in. In late May the meadows explode in wild flowers. It is really a site to see and does the soul good after a long week in the concrete and asphalt of the city. Not only free to the public but accessible via public transportation. Food and lodging available at Snowbird, which stays open year round, as does its tram."

     "comment": "After living here for about six months and motorcycle riding various canyons, I have to say that Little Cottonwood is my favorite. Without taking anything away from Big Cottonwood, Emigration, and other local canyons, the views in Little Cottonwood are the best, in my opinion. Even if you don't ski, grab lunch at Alta Lodge -- lunch prices are comparable to an Applebee's or Chili's -- and just enjoy the scenery. In warm weather, drive past the gate at Alta and up the dirt road for even more spectacular views (and great hiking). Follow the road to the parking lot for the camping area, and hike up to the lake. Beautiful scenery and a pretty terrific motorcycle road make Little Cottonwood my top pick for local canyons!"

     "comment": "We headed up the canyon to do a bit of hiking and were happy to find out that the wildflowers were in bloom. There's a meadow wildflower hiking trail to follow--and it was great. It's moderately difficult--we're not claiming to be in great shape, but the elevation and a few of the steep inclines, made us stop to catch our breath (but there were elderly folks and young kids stomping up and down this hike--so you know, i guess we are out of shape). The views are great, the wildflowers were gorgeous. We got to catch a deer grazing and of course all kinds of little critters and birds. Great views down the valley. Our time was short, so we didn't get a chance to spend more time here, they were running lifts up to one of the peaks and there are some restaurants open--but we needed to spend only about an hour of our time. It was totally worth it, though and highly recommended."

     "comment": "People define beauty differently, but it's difficult to beat the beauty of Little Cottonwood Canyon. From the city limits of Sandy to the end of the trail above the ski resorts, the winding road takes you from pines and aspens, through fir and spruce, and up above the tree line. If you're there for the bloom of the spring wildflowers, the views are truly breathtaking.\nThe fauna can be spectacular as well. The canyon is home to many species of birds and fish as well as squirrels, pine martin, deer, and other Rocky Mountain creatures. This is also the one place where I can almost always spot a moose.\nTake a day or just a two-hour drive. Take a picnic or just a bottle of water. Take your family or just a friend, but definitely take advantage of this spectacular natural wonder."

     "comment": "A friend and I decided to go on a little hike towards Alta. We picked a perfect day. It was sunny, warm, however lots of snow was still on the ground (there was an unexpected snow storm two days before). The paths were freshly groomed by snow grooming machines. The hike was very pleasant, and easy. Most ski lifts were opened, few skiers, a couple of show-shoers.\nAfter climbing to one of the lifts, we sat on rocks to eat snacks and enjoy breath taking views. One complain - as a first time visitor - no trail maps, the official trail site does not specify which trails are not accessible until summer. We wanted actually to go to Cecret Lake, but learned from a local person, that it is truly a summer hike. However we both had a good time on whatever trail that was"

Climbing up side canyons introduces you to White Pine, or Red Pine Lakes, Cecret Lake, Albion Basin, and the world class ski resorts of Alta and Snowbird. The clean, simple beauty of this canyon is unique not only to the Wasatch Mountains, but is unusually scenic compared to any other place I have visited. A portion of my heart resides here."

Climbing is also popular.\nLocals and visitors alike benefit from this beautiful canyon whether or not they leave their car as the sounds, smells, and sights will bring smiles to all."

You may encounter moose, mountain goats, deer, coyote, and other wildlife if you look hard and hike a little. And of course, winter boasts the iconic Alta powder and Snowbird terrain that make this a destination for real deal skiers."

About 1000m vertical ascent with a near constant uphill for over 20km or 13 miles. It’s a tough climb but I found plenty of places to stop and I did that quite a lot. My Garmin showed up to 13% gradient and on my not friendly hire bike gearing it was very tough. Good news there’s plenty places to stop, take a drink and take in the beautiful scenery.\nYou can get up over 8000 feet or 2500m and I was there in November. There was snow around and plenty on the high mountains and it’s cool towards the top of course, but I was warm enough for a short sleeve jersey. On the way down I put everything on! Keep the windchill out and make sure you have decent brakes!"

We always pack a lunch for days like this in hopes of finding a quiet place to stop and enjoy a picnic. The road runs along the river, and we found the perfect spot to sit and watch the rapids. Highly recommend this scenic drive."

The grandeur and majesty of these mountain are mind blowing. The hiking trails themselves are tough. There are few “easy” hikes and most have significant elevation gains. Makes sure to bring lots of water!"

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon has two ski resorts, Brighton and Solitude. Brighton has great deals for family skiing. Solitude has some expert only ski runs. They both have long skiing seasons as well.\nBut during the summer it is a great place to escape the heat and get away from the city. There are many trails, some of them for overnight camping.\nThere are a number of locations for camping and improved sites, as well as the hike in camping.There are group campsites as well.\nChildren will love walking around the lake up at the Brighton ski resort during the summer. They should be able to see some fish in the shallow lake.\nAnd it is especially beautiful in the fall, when the vibrant autumn leaves or contrast to the evergreen trees.\nIt is very convenient as the mouth of the canyon is no more than 20 minutes from the heart of Salt Lake City."

There were 3 scenic roads you could take through these mountains, that I know of, and we did just that. Lots of beautiful views of canyons, rivers, mountain sides, and cities down below.\nThe roads are very narrow in some locations and lots of curves in the road. Some steep drop offs may make you nervous or excited. Plenty of road side parks and trail heads to get off on and explore. The leaves were starting to change for the fall and were beautiful.\nNot sure I would take kids under 8 years of age there unless they listen well and don't wander off.\nDefinitely worth the trip."

Beautiful scenery along the way and if you like to hike there are a number of trails on the 16-mile route. Stop by the lodge for breakfast or coffee along the way (about 10 miles in) and keep going to Park City which is gorgeous (like Ashville NC). It’s a mid-day trip to Park City on a lazy Sunday. We ended our journey in the Visitors Center of the Great Salt Lake. Highly recommend that you start early in the morning."

It's a great place to hike, has beautiful scenery and if you have little kids or elderly friends and family, there's a nice gentle walk at the top, by Brighton Ski resort, around Silver Lake. If you go at dusk, you're likely to see Moose as you stroll the boardwalk around the lake. There are interpretive signs along the way, restrooms and a small information center. If you're hungry, stop at Silver Fork Lodge for a bite to eat, just minutes from the lake as you descend the canyon."

There are lots of places to pull over and take photos from or to go on hikes. Unfortunately, you can't take your dogs on the trails because this is a water shed area that supplies the drinking water for Salt Lake City residents.

Then you enter an area with steep,dramatic rocky mountains that come down to the level of the road. It is breathtaking! There are turnoffs and a camp ground where photo moments are accessible. After navigating a series of switchbacks the landscape opens up to vistas of heavily forested mountains and you are driving toward two popular ski areas,Solitude and Brighton. Both have great skiing and numerous restaurants and shops at their base.\nThis canyon is popular and crowded year round.\nFishing,camping,shopping,hiking are also available.\nIf you visit Salt Lake City anytime of the year, this is a must trip. You will love it!\nP.S. I am not employed by the chamber of commerce. I live here and hope you will enjoy this beautiful canyon"

I'm a home owner in the canyon and often see piles of broken glass at the trail heads from nasty thieves that wait for hikers to leave so they can do a smash and run with your valuables. In the summer, selfie-taking motorists litter the road side as LOUD Harley's rumble past in large SLOW moving groups. In the winter, especially on a powder day, better plan on making sure there is a place to park at the ski area before you spend 1.5 hours in a line of traffic so you don't get turned back. When departing BCC on a powder day or a holiday or some random day for no reason, it may take you up to 2 hours to get down the canyon.\nSomething must be done. This is heartbreaking. TAKE THE BUS! CARPOOL! GO TO COLORADO!"

They can also catch their first fish from the pier. The state stocks Silver Lake most of the summer starting just before the 4th of July. The skiing in BBC pretty good for the area.

     "comment": "In my opinion, there is no better place in the United States for access to a vast array of mountain adventures than Salt Lake City, Utah. Big Cottonwood Canyon is just minutes away from all the amenities of the city, but when you get there it is like getting away from it all. The hiking opportunities in the canyon are terrific. I especially enjoy Donut Falls for an easy walk or the Lake Mary Trail above Brighton for a little more exercise. There are also much more strenuous hikes for when I'm energetic. There are numerous mountain bike trails and rock climbing areas as well. I've enjoyed camping in the canyon or driving the dirt road over the top to go into Park City. In the winter, the snowsports in Big Cottonwood Canyon are exceptional. The famous ski resorts in Little Cottonwood Canyon - Alta and Snowbird - are wonderful, but the locals know that Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood Canyon are just as good, are more reasonably priced, and often not as crowded. There is also an excellent cross-country ski center and miles of back country options as well. Simply put, Big Cottonwood Canyon is an outdoor paradise."

     "comment": "As retired 78-year-olds who love to travel, we are more prone to sight-seeing or walking on a beach than hiking or skiing or biking or certainly rock climbing. But all of that and more is on the plate in Big Cottonwood Canyon in Utah. Located in the Wasatch Range 12 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, the 15-mile-long canyon provides hiking, biking, picnicking, rock climbing, camping and fishing in the summer. In the winter, its two ski resorts, Brighton and Solitude, are popular destinations for skiers and cross-country skiers, snowshoe hikers and snowboarders. For sight-seers and folks who enjoy fresh mountain air, the canyon is accessed by The Big Cottonwood Canyon Scenic Byway, which runs its length to Guardsman Pass at the top of the canyon, allowing travel to Park City in the summer months. Hiking to the canyon's mountain lakes is a popular activity, with many trails leading to lakes such as Mary, Martha and Katherine. The canyon's most popular hiking trail, 3.1 miles long and very strenuous, leads to Lakes Blanche, Florence and Lillian. The canyon also is a frequent destination for Utah Native Plant Society wildflower walks and for University of Utah botanical field trips. Storm Mountain is a popular picnic site and S-Curve Area is a favorite gathering place for rock climbers. A drive through the canyon with your car windows open is as refreshing as a dip in cold water."

Do remember that Silver lake is located at the Brighton ski resort and that means :Beware\" of elevation and temperature, even in the summertime. Brook and Rainbow trout thrive in cold waters and that should serve as a notice to you.

The trail is very well maintained and moderate in difficulty because of the long uphill climb. The views are spectacular especially today with the colorful leaves peaking. There were other people there, but I wouldn't call it crowded. We just did the 5 southern national parks....that's crowded. This hike rivaled any hike in the parks. The drive is gorgeous. You can climb an extra 1/2 mile to the ridge above the lake and see Park City views and make this a 9 mile hike. Wonderful scenery and a great way to enjoy the beautiful area."

On the weekend, if you're not there crazy early, forget about it. Trailhead parking is mobbed. Even parking on the shoulder gets congested. They may have to consider making it a fee area. Sadly, it's getting loved to death. We used to come for weeks every summer, but we're moved a lot of our mountain time to Colorado to avoid the hordes. When we do come, we ride bikes up from the mouth of the canyon to Brighton and back down to Silverfork for breakfast. If we hike, we get the trailhead bright and early. Try weekdays and early mornings if you want to enjoy nature without the crush of cars and people."

     "comment": "I managed to escape the insanity of the city one afternoon and drove up to Big Cottonwood Canyon. It is a huge area and, depending on your desires can results in a leisurely stroll around Silver Lake, of present a more strenuous activity. Even if you decide not to get out of the car (no judgement) it is worth the journey to see the beauty that is the Rocky Mountains. For those of you who do choose to do some exploring, note the elevation can exceed 8000 feet, which means the air can be a bit thin. So take your time and enjoy the journey.\nSome have said that it can be very crowded, which does not surprise me, given it is so near SLC. But if you can manage a trip during the week, you will have no problem finding the peace and solitude you seek. As I was there in late August, the wildflowers were already gone, but I can imagine their Spring beauty. Regardless, it was a wonderful afternoon of trails, lakes and fauna."

It's amazing.\nTwin Lakes, Lake Solitude, Silver Lake, Lake Mary, Lake Katherine , Lake Blanche, Donut Falls, Dog Log, etc etc etc ...\nJust to name a few of some of the best hiking in the valley.\nThen there is \"The Silver Fork Lodge\" for fine dining. And if you want a very quaint get away. Perfect for an event or wedding as well.\nThat doesn't even touch the dining at Solitude ... or the Frisbee golf course.\nOr the mountain biking trails!\nIt's absolutely breathtaking.\nAnd ... let's talk skiing. I love Brighton ... it's such a nicely groomed fun place. Solitude to me is for the real experience skiers.\nTo me - this canyon is great for all four seasons.\nThe only con ... is everyone knows about it! It's very crowded on weekends, etc.\nStill one of my favorites for outdoor enthusiasts."

We were on East Coast time, so we were in the canyon before 6 AM, but it was still overwhelmingly crowded with runners, bicyclists, and hikers. We hiked Donut Falls without too many people that early, but there were tons of people coming up when we were coming down. Then we hiked some trails at Guardsmans Pass. Parking was crazy, but we didn’t see too many people on the trail to the peak. The views were stunning!!! The trail to the lake was very busy and there were a ton of dogs, but it was still peaceful. Overall, a wonderful visit!"

We purchased a little book at the local REI with has short and very useful descriptions of all the major hikes. We also have a topographic map in case we get off the trail.\nMake sure that you are prepared for the hikes, the temperature can be pretty cool in the morning and in the evening, pack an extra layer. A bug spray is also recommended, some of the shady trails have mosquitoes because of the alpine lakes.\nKeep in mind, this canyon is a water shed area, the city gets its water from he melting snow, and in an effort to keep the canyon clean, they do not let dogs in the canyon. If you want to hike with dogs, you need to go to Millcreek Canyon. Make sure that you check the leash laws, dogs can go off leash there every odd day only."

It starts of pretty soft down in the woods, but turns steeper and steeper. The last (estimate) parts of the hike consists of about 500 meters covered in loose rocks in all sizes. You won’t meet many others on this hike, but is a very rewarding and stunning view when you get to the top. We also saw a Moose a long the way - nice! See the pics attached.\nPs: don’t go this trip if you aren’t in shape. In particular the last parts of the trip is tough. Bring a lot of food and water. Water can also be refilled along the way. We spent about 7,5 hours on this hike."

The real highlight is at the top end, at Brighton Ski resort and Silver Lake Ranger Station. The scenery up here is beautiful and the variety of hiking options is great. The hikes range from a flat 1 mile hike around an alpine lake behind the ranger station to long uphill treks to several alpine lakes above the Brighton Lodge. There is a small store across the road from the ranger station, and they also grill hot dogs and burgers during lunch time."

While the Silver Lake Loop is on a boardwalk and accessible for strollers, families with small children, etc, the Lake Solitude trail has a fairly moderate elevation gain at the start, then levels off into an easier hike. This is not, however, a trail for strollers. The landscape and vistas from the Lake Solitude trail are beautiful and it is quiet. There were not a lot of other hikers out, but it was a weekday when we were there. We did run into a moose, but we left her alone and she left us alone. Great place to hike and get away from it all."

But please be careful around the streams during the spring runoff - water is VERY cold and moves very fast!

     "comment": "The drive up Big Cottonwood Canyon takes you past numerous areas to have picnics or stop to paint on a canvas or photo ops or hike into a mountain lake and streams. It is what I call our little \"alps\" -- for the well-maintained paved canyon road takes you in just a few miles right up into the alpine vistas as well as secluded glades and mountain meadows. Numerous places to explore, especially when the wildflowers are in bloom in late spring and summer (blooms usually come on a little later due to altitude, melting snow-pack, and spring rains) and you can participate in wildflower tours of several areas near ski resorts. If you are a history buff, the Wasatch canyons including Big Cottonwood have mining history beside the skiing industry. It's rugged and serene and you get away from city rushing around. You can get used to the quick ride up to the mountains as they are so close; once there, though, it is a fresh discovery each trip, never quite the same, though familiar and attainable. Big Cottonwood is called \"big\" because it has the longest miles of road up the canyon compared to Little Cottonwood Canyon \"next door\" to the south. These are only two of the many canyons that feed the Great Salt Lake Valley, and were formed respectively by glaciers (Little Cottonwood, U-shaped canyon) and rivers/streams (Big Cottonwood, V-shaped canyon). Wander here and enjoy!"

There were canyons, mountains and creeks with lush flora - was indeed a very pleasing experience for the eyes. Pulled over at multiple spots beside the road to click photographs and to simply listen to the mellow flow of streams.\nI strongly urge folks to do the drive. Estimate around 40 minutes one way drive from Salt Lake City with no stops in between. Of course, most likely folks will stop for photos or simply to take in the views and that will add some time. I did not have time to explore the ski resort or do any hike and hence can't comment on those but purely based on the wonderful and refreshing drive, this place gets a huge thumbs up from me."

Much of the trail had melting snow so walk/run shoes at the minimum; traction necessary; trekking poles or cane not a bad idea if you aren't somewhat fit or you happen to be a tad frail. I lost track of the number of photos but I wish my phone could have captured the aroma of dense fir and mulch and crisp air... Enjoy!

The road is paved and adequate with only one lane in each direction. It is medium steep with lots of curves, but easy to drive at safe speeds. There are many places to pull off to enjoy a picnic breakfast,lunch or dinner with tables, fire pits. Hiking trails are well marked. There is a lake at the top of the canyon that has a boardwalk all the way around it. It's an easy walk for anyone. In the fall the colors are spectacular. There are a few restaurants along the canyon drive, but bringing your own food is the best way to enjoy a meal in natural beauty."

The canyon is absolutely stunning with a beautiful stream that follows the canyon floor. The rock formations are majestic and speak to amazing forces that formed the canyon long ago. We have only been during the winter time when snow can get quite deep further up the canyon. Compared to Little Cottonwood Canyon, home to Alta and Snowbird ski resorts, Big Cottonwood Canyon is far less crowded, thus the name Solitude. We love the Inn at Solitude where we stay for the slope-side accommodations and friendly staff. The mountain has something for every skier. Don't miss the first tracks skiing on Sunday and Monday for Inn guests as well as the rescue dog demonstration on Saturday afternoon."

It’s a beautiful meander in the spring, summer and fall, and a cross country dreamland in the winter on snow covered frozen ice. On the spring through fall hike, there are wildflowers, docks you can fish off, .and moose to photograph.\nIf you’d like a more rigorous trail that heads up and overlooksl the lake, take the transecting trail that heads upwards.\nWhen you return to the parking lot, there are lavatories, a map and explanation of how the Mormon pioneers celebrated the 24th of July at the lake, and across the parking lot is a nice, woodsy shop with ice cream and other eatables, as well as great books on the flora and fauna of the region.\nOf course if you still have energy, across the way is Brighton Ski Resort with many more lakes and trails."

It is a beautiful place full of hiking trails and places to explore. It has great ski resorts and most of all, beautiful scenery. I go up there at least 4 times a year and more just to get away from the city below it. I recommend it as a great place for whatever kind of adventure you are into. The only reason give less stars is because of the areas you can’t go into because of private ownership."

It is even more spectacular in the winter when the waterfall freezes. It is a little more treacherous with ice and snow to contend with at the end but well worth it if you go prepared with proper gear. Young families often go sledding by the parking lot. Hiking and skiing are great! Something for everyone to enjoy! Year round fun and beauty!"

We spend some time strolling around Silver Lake (sad to say, the visitor center was not open) and then decided to hike up to Lake Mary.\nFor those not in the know, there is parking for the Lake Mary hike right near the Brighton Ski Lift.\nThe hike was FABULOUS. It's not a long distance from trailhead to lake, but it is rather vertical. The lake itself is an alpine gem, with snow covered mountains in the back and wonderful views.\nI should warn others that there was already ice on the trail in mid-October, some of it hidden by dirt. But if you watch your step (particularly on the way down), you'll find this a truly memorable hike!"

It is also not too late for a good hike--try Dog Lake up Butler's Fork and down Mill D north fork for a great half-day moderately strenuous one. Or Donut Falls for an easy hour. Or Cecret Lake for moderate.\nJuly is best for wildflowers.\nOf course, skiing in the winter!\nGo most of the way up and then over Guardsman Pass into charming Midway and get some ice cream & cheese at Heber Valley Artisan Cheeses."

I would have given 5 circles but I had read that the hike started at the Lodge instead of the Center and the sign for the hike was just placed against a tree. We followed a path for about fifteen minutes before we decided it wasn't right and we turned around. We did get to see a deer on that trail so it was worth it. On the correct trail, we saw a moose at Dog Lake and I had never seen one before, so this was definitely a highlight!"

Silver Lake to Lake Solitude is a perfect hike for me alone or with children. Donut Falls is also a mild hike. Lake Mary has to be one of the most beautiful lakes on this planet -- a deep blue that took some dedicated workers to build. You can still find the building implements left at the site. There's Dog Lake, Lake Blanche, and the Albion Trail if you want to cross over into Little Cottonwood Canyon. Even in the middle of summer, I frequently find snow patches so the temps are quite exhilarating."

     "comment": "Less than 30 minutes from downtown SLC, the drive up the canyon makes for a nice escape to nature. The drive itself is beautiful, with amazing rock formations the first few miles, followed by wildflowers, waterfalls, and green meadows. There are many places along the way to pull over for better views and to get some great photos. There are some amazing hiking trails and some nice spots to simply sit, relax, and take in nature. The drive takes you to Solitude Resort, then to Brighton Resort, about two miles further up the road, where the canyon ends. During the summer, I highly recommend taking the drive up Guardsman's Pass, which is an incredibly scenic drive that takes you up to the backside of Jupiter Bowl at Park City, then down into the Deer Valley Resort area. At the top of the pass, there's a small dirt parking lot, where you can park and spend some time taking in the amazing views. If you want to stand at the top of Jupiter Bowl and look back over Park City, there is a small dirt road that curves up the hill across the street. It's about a 1/4 mile uphill walk, but it's relatively easy and you'll be rewarded with some terrific views.\nIf you're short on time, the drive up and back through Big Cottonwood Canyon will take less than two hours round trip from downtown SLC, assuming no stops along the way. If you have several hours, it's well worth making the Guardsman's Pass drive, then exploring Deer Valley and Park City before returning to SLC via I-80."

The road is narrow in spots with a few tight bends, but it is well maintained and paved. I was in the canyon most recently to beat the heat with a short hike to Donut Falls on a hot summer day. The trail was crowded, as there were many people who had the same great idea, but it was still a lovely jaunt into wildflowers, meadows, and over a few rocks. There was plenty of wildlife to see despite the humans. The falls are pretty, but a little underwhelming, but in this case, it's about the journey as much as it is about the destination."

     "comment": "Which is a shame really as there seemed so much to do here. Not really for the average climber, the routes are way too hard, and the gradings seem to be off by about 2 grades compared to elsewhere (a 5.7 feels like a 5.9). As the median grade here is about a 5.11b, you will get crowded out in the weekends as there aren't relatively that many easier climbs here.\nThe climbs are on quartzite, a type of metamorphasised sandstone, which normally is quite strong (see the Arapiles in Australia). However this place seemed to have a lot of loose rock, and it was hard to place nuts/stoppers. So you need quite a big rack of cams to climb here (20?). Having said that, the quartzite here is an excellent challenge for those who want to be a truly international climber, but seems to be stuck on granite which dominates 70% of USA crags. It can have a slippery surface, and it will take a while to read where the holds are!\nThe routes are typically 1-3 pitches long so not a big day out/adventure. And you need to start early so you don't get caught by summer afternoon thunderstorms.\nGood luck :)"

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon is one of the two canyons that end at the Salt Lake area's famous Wasatch mountain ski resorts (Little Cottonwood Canyon is the other). In the summer, they are stunning scenic drives that provide access to many hiking trails. In my opinion Big Cottonwood Canyon is the more dramatic of the two, and if you're only going to explore one of them, I say choose this one. Not only is the scenery awe-inspiring, but the drive ends in a loop through the tiny but picturesque ski resort town of Brighton. In Brighton, you can stop at the cafe and relax and enjoy the view of the mountain amphitheater that surrounds the town. Important note: there are no dogs allowed in the canyon at all (for protection of the watershed)."

The vistas along this route are fantastic, and there are several trailheads along the way if you have time for a hike. In one spot, we counted 20 hawks flying over a meadow and enjoying the mountain breeze - gliding up, diving at high speed and racing by us - that was a treat. I will use this as a slower but much more beautiful route to/from Park City (season permitting - parts of this route are closed during snow season)."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon has it ALMOST all: Wonderful ski resorts (Brighton and my favorite Solitude), breathtaking scenery, easy to difficult hiking trails, inexpensive and quaint campgrounds and more. HOWEVER, and this is a big drawback, canines aren't allowed up there because it is a watershed and the waste presents a problem. Now, I am arguably one of the biggest dog lovers on Earth, so when I want to take my Australian Kelpie hiking, I avoid this canyon and the potentially hundreds of dollars in fines I might face if caught with Lyla up there. So, instead I tend to go to nearby Millcreek Canyon. I LOVE the atmosphere and terrain at Solitude Resort and the group of characters, called the FOGS (check for the group's Facebook Page) who congregate and tailgate there mostly on Sundays and Wednesdays. It has changed a bit since it was bought by Deer Valley Resort in 2015. But it's still got the least crowded lines and coolest patrons and staff in my opinion. So if you want to hike or camp there, leave Fido at home (bummer, I spend as much time with my dog as I can, and aside from skiing up there I don't go very often). Oh, and the nordic skiing is excellent there too and snowshoeing."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon hosts the beautiful Solitude and Brighton Ski Resorts. In addition, the canyon has great hiking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. One of my favorite hikes is to park near The Pines and hike to Donut Falls. It is an easy hike at any time of the year. In the winter, the fall comes down the mountain under the snow at the end of the roughly 2.0 mile hike through the woods (on marked trails). Visitors climb up a somewhat steep, but short canyon wall and then slide down into a cave that opens into a large cavern. The waterfall flows through a hole in the ceiling. Rimmed in ice, it is absolutely stunning. To get down from the cave, most people sit down and slide on their ski pants or even haul up sleds and use them. This is a very popular spot for families. The views are great in winter and summer."

We hiked to Blood Lake for a swim in the refreshing (but chilly) waters. For the adventerous, there is a rope swing, but be prepared to wait your turn. The trail up and back is a moderate climb with only a couple of places steep enough to make you consider where best to plant your feet. Ideal footwear is anything with some tread. Wildflowers are near peak there now, though not quiet as many as Little Cottonwood Canyon... nonetheless, and rewarding hike."

Went in the summer so was lucky to have reached there by 11am when the sun was not as strong plus most of the trail has tall trees around it. Many families visit this place and some even brought their picnic basket!"

That was great to see but just make sure to take it slow when driving as there are quite a few blind corners. The scenery was beautiful and the temperature change, about 20 degrees, was great on a 100 degree day is Salt Lake. Would like to go back when we have more time."

The ski resorts are closed but yet there was just enough snow on Monday, June 12 to take some good photos and feel the 35+ wind in your face.\nThe total distance was about 47 miles and took 2 hours including stops to take photos. I am planning to do once more in July to see how the peaks look without the snow this time.\nDid not come across any wild-life on my first trip and I was lucky that the pass was just opened in the first week of June."

     "comment": "It seems a little weird reviewing a canyon, rather than a business of establishment, but this canyon is worth it. We went on a week day evening last month, and had a fantastic time.\nIt has been an odd spring this year, with lots of snow and lower temperatures, and then heating up fairly quickly. As a result, the stream is running very high. We stopped just below Storm Mountain and did some exploring, and it was amazing to see the power and beauty of the river cascading down the canyon. Further up, by the \"S-curve\" we got out to see the waterfalls, but didn't have time to hike to Lake Blanche (one of our favorites) this trip. We continued up the canyon to Brighton and saw a moose by Silver Lake, and were planning on going up over Guardsman Pass to Park City, but it was still closed off and had several feet of snow on the road. Can't wait until a little more melts so we can get through. Will definitely be back through the summer and fall to hike Lake Catherine, Mary and Martha as they are a great couple of hour hike."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon is well known for Outdoor Recreation with an abundance of Backcountry Skiing in the Winter and Hiking in the Summer. It is also home to Brighton and Solitude Ski Resorts. Known as BCC to the locals it has a rich Mining History as well. Bus Service is available during Ski Season and Lodging is very limited.\nFor those who are driving from downtown Salt Lake City, it is about 16 miles to the mouth of the Canyon; it is another 16 miles to Brighton. About 13 miles up, you will approach a Cabin Community where lunch and dinner is available at the Silver Fork Lodge. A few miles further, you will see the main entrance to Solitude Ski Resort. Further on, you will see a village of private condominiums.\nAs you pass the Fire Station, you will be entering another Cabin Community, Brighton. On Brighton Loop Road, you will first see the Solitude Nordic Center. Once the snow melts, there is a popular boardwalk around Silver Lake also accessed at the Center. If you continue on the Loop, you will see Brighton Ski Resort. In the summer, there are several lakes that make for great destinations for hikers. Lake Mary tends to be the better choice for families. Mt. Wolverine and Sunset Peak are reserved for the more ambitious.\nAs you begin your descent down the Canyon, there is one additional road worth a look, Guardsman's Pass. It is closed for winter but is usually accessible Memorial Day through Labor Day. At the pass you can look into the Heber Valley and if you choose proceed over the pass; use caution as the grade is steep and although rare, some vehicles have driven over the side. This route is quite scenic and does take some time, but eventually you'll reach Deer Valley and Park City (stay left), or Midway and Heber (stay right).\nIf you continue back down BCC, take note that Mining for Silver and Gold was quite active during the late 1800's; a good eye will be able to spot some of the mine entrances. While many of these entrances are closed or collapsed, it is not advised to venture inside as there is the potential risk of injury and death. If hiking, you will often find remnants, such as tailings, structures and equipment. One other historic structure of interest is the Utah Power Stairs Plant, which is still in use to date.\nWhile skiing is the rave during the winter, Hiking is the bomb during the summer. Popular hikes include, Doughnut Falls, Dog Lake and Lake Blanche, where you will gaze at Sundial Peak. Aside from Delicate Arch, Moab... Sundial Peak is the second most featured photograph for the State of Utah. Due to its popularity, this trail can be quite crowded and parking hard to find if you get a late start to your day. Rock Climbing on quartzite slabs is also quite popular in the Storm Mountain area.\nWhether you are a Powder Hound in the winter or a Rock Hound in the summer, Adventure Awaits you in Big Cottonwood Canyon, where there is something for everyone. From a fantasy of fall colored leaves in September to the cold smoke powder in January, you won’t be disappointed. In July, you may be fortunate to see an array of wildflowers about the meadows; beware of Moose, they can be very aggressive. And if you are really adventurous, consider Mt. Superior along the Cottonwood Ridge or the Broad Fork Twins, breathtaking summits that exceed 11,000 feet in elevation.\nThere is more than meets the eye, so plan ahead. There are numerous publications describing the hiking routes and official websites for both resorts. The Canyon is well patrolled, so watch your speed and passing zones; there is also a volunteer Search and Rescue Team. Please Stay Safe and Enjoy Responsibly!!!"

In the spring and summer great beutahful hiking to lakes or peaks. Good opportunities to see Utah wildlife (deer and moose). Fall get up and check the fall colors as the leaves change.\nLocated 10 miles from downtown SLC it is easy for a quick afternoon drive or hike. The hikes range from easy to difficult so you can find something at your ability level.\nYou will not regret getting up into this canyon."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon is incredible. The top places to visit include:\n1) Silver Lake - This is lake at the base of Brighton Ski Resort. It the summer it is stocked with Trout and is great for fishing. I fish from the shore using Jake's spinner's and always catch fish. The lake is shallow and tends to get lots of growth as the Summer get's later. You can bring a float tube, canoe or small boat and fish from the middle. There is a mile trail walking around the lake that is beautiful and very easy (my 78 year old mother enjoyed this walk).\n2) Spruces Campground - This is located ~ 2/3 up the canyon. It is a Federal Camp Ground and books up early, however they have campsites that can be reserved only by walk up so even if the website says it's full if you go early in the morning you can almost always get a campsite. These campsites are well taken care of with access to bathrooms and some of hookups. It is a great campground with full shade and very mature trees.\n3) Guardsman Pass - This is located at the top of Big Cottonwood canyon. Take the turnoff just before Brighton Ski Resort. This road takes you to the top of the mountain and down into Park City or down into Midway/Heber. This is a gorgeous drive in the fall. On Holidays it gets very crowded and there is much room on the road and people park on the side and there are cars coming up and going down. Just be patient and you'll be fine (or go on a weekday and there won't be any traffic).\n4) Solitude Disc Golfing - Solitude has a great disc golf course. You can ride the lift or just hike (I've always hiked and it's a good little hike). The holes are well marked. Be careful to keep an eye on your discs as they can be lost in the woods and grass very easily. You'll see moose and all kinds of birds on this course. Excellent!\n5) At the base of Solitude there is a little Pizza Place that serves the best pizza! I only get it when we are camping or playing disc golf because it's quite the drive to the top of the mountain...but the pizza is well worth it.\nThere are lots of other hikes up Big Cottonwood Canyon and Storm Mountain is a great place for a picnic.\nBig Cottonwood Canyon is the Canyon to play in for SLC."

     "comment": "I went hiking further south in another canyon and after lunch decided to visit Silver Lake on a whim with the intention of hiking to the other lakes nearby.\nBefore I made my way I checked the road conditions and it was open so assumed the trail was open also. When arriving at Silver Lake there was still snow cover for which I wasn't equipped to hike upon. Oh, well. This was a 8 May visit and signs along the canyon road indicate that snow can be an issue up to mid-May.\nI do recommend this place but in early May try to find out about remaining snow cover and don't go on a Sunday afternoon as most of the parking at the various trail heads, etc. fill up quick."

As you climb you['ll cross meadows, pass through the aspen zone and even have a chance to pull off and enjoy nature.

You can also enjoy the myriad trails on snowshoes during the winter.\nIn late spring to early fall, the hiking and mountain biking trails are fantastic. Some of my favorites include Brighton Lakes, Hidden Falls, Donut Falls, and Willow Heights.\nIn summer, you can also climb a number of mountain peaks. Sunset Peak and Clayton Peak are both fun summits and don't require a lot of experience to climb."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon (BCC) is one of the 2 of the largest canyons fronting the Wasatch Front/SLC Valley. This canyon is mostly water eroded, V-shaped sedimentary rock and not glaciated other than the upper stretches of it (in contrast with Little Cottonwood which is starkly different with U-shape from both glaciation and metamorphic rock). Both of the canyons are great scenic drives. Know the kind way to drive in the West is to pull off if blocking up traffic, as you can then soak in the scenery (makes it more enjoyable for all). 2 of the main ski resorts are in this canyon (Solitude, Brighton). There are multiple hikes ranging from easy to hard. There are easy hikes with minimal elevation gain. Realize hard/strenuous means not for younger kids, or low or average shape folks. BCC is becoming progressively more busy over the decades and now most popular hiking trails have no parking by about 0900-1000. There are only a few restaurants in the canyon, but they are good ones."

     "comment": "This was a wonderful scenic drive outside of Salt Lake City. I should have taken my time more to appreciate the scenery, but with high snow banks with was difficult to pull off the road. It's worthwhile to note that the area can be restricted to AWD with snow tires/chains if there is fresh snowfall. I lucked out and was not restricted in early February, but my Nissan Sentra rental car definitely struggled up and down the hills. I was missing my AWD Subaru during this drive!"

     "comment": "Having lived here beginning in the later 70's this place was magical and set the tone for what it was like to live near a area that provided wilderness experience close in. Over the years of course Salt Lake in general has grown leaps and bounds and this place is only amazing on NON weekends and NON holidays as it is over run with tourists and locals alike. Traffic is a drag as is the load of people about. If you are fortunate to pick the right day you'll be treated to an experience unlike other places will typically provide. The flavor of wilderness close by. Fresh air and amazing flora, fauna, wildlife, small lakes and mountain terrain. Be sure to bring good comfortable shoes and more if hiking. Water as well. Just soak it up and you will love it."

Solitude as one of the nicest locations for thin air 20 km of groomed trails. Skimo is also an option for the more adventurous people. Too many options to list here.\nSummer offers great hiking for all levels of abilities, whether a short stroll around Silver Lake, or more strenuous hikes up to higher lakes in some of the most beautiful settings of the Wasatch.\nAt only 30 minutes from Salt Lake City, the question is, do you have the time to enjoy all that this canyon has to offer?"

You can drive to the top, I think its about a 15 mile drive up to the ski resort with pretty hikes and picnic areas around the lake and then you can go across Guardsman's Pass into Park City. That's a really pretty drive too. :D"

These days it costs money to visit a campground even for a picnic. At the top of the canyon there is a big parking lot at the base of the ski lifts. Stopping there just to smell the air and look at the mountains is wonderful. The hike to lakes Mary, Martha and Katherine is uphill but worth the effort."

Snow boots are a must.\nThis is my first time hiking in the winter. The scenery was great. Even though couple sections of trail were very steep, I really enjoyed.\nWe just finished 2.4 miles (one way). The snow was not packed on the rest of miles.

Lake Mary, easy hike go there.\nFall; colors galore; go drive this canyon for beautiful colors. So many shades of green, brown, orange, red!\nWinter; snow show, skim, snowboard, ski. Brighton is the local resort, understand its a place with chalets and some rooms, but it is not snowbird or park city or solitude. This is where locals come to rip, bbq and drink. It's becoming a little more.strict but is still the spot for good times if you can meet some dope locals. Solitude has places to stay for sure, they have a lot of rooms and cabins for any size of party.\nI can tell you more if you need more specifics! The above is just a brief seasonal review. Photo below is me at the top of brighton close to pioneer ridge in winter and summer! Tried photo is the backside of brighton from crest lift. Some backcountry that is probably insane but sketchy.

We had our own equipement so our cost was $14 for 2 people. You can rent equipment.We enjoyed the scenery. We took our time and hiked for about 1 1/2 hours. We drove up the canyon again on Christmas day to see the 2 feet of snow the canyon had received. Beautiful!!! Love this drive any time of the year. Take time to see the beauty.

Fall brings incredible colors as the leafs change. Winter brings massive amounts of the best powder. Average 500 inches, Brighton and solitude ski and snowboard resorts are some of the best in the USA. Come visit you will love this very special place"

The sign clearly marked for which way. If you are going to Big Cottonwood Canyon you will make a left turn on Cottonwood Road. If you are going to Little Cottonwood Canyon you will go straight.\nAs you drove along the Big Cotton, there are many places you can stop and hike. Our purpose was to go through Guardsman's Pass and into Park City. Unfortunately, Guardsman's Pass was closed for the season, so we make a U turn back down.\nIf your goal is Guardsman's Pass, as soon as you pass Silver Lodge Place, you will need to make a left turn up the hill and onto Guardsman's Pass. There will be sign for Guardsman's Pass."

The hike would have been easy, if it wasn't for the snow and ice on the trail. We made it up and down fine, but just slower then normal. It look us about 2 hours round trip with a little time at the top too. The surroundings for the hike were great! The lake at the top is nice, as long as you don't look at the cement reservoir wall. We heard that there is also a possibility of moose sightings on this trail, but didn't see any on our hike.\nThe drive through the Canyon was great! I was really glad we made time for it!"

There are fewer crowds than other resorts with the same quality of skiing. Brighton has amazing skiing as well with great deals for families with children. If you come in the summer make sure to visit Silver Lake. If you're up for it a hike, go to Donut Falls or Mary Lake. Each provides spectacular sights and sounds. You'll feel great because you're in the great outdoors getting some mild exercise and some fresh mountain air. Enjoy!!"

The drive starts out next to a beautiful creek. Several trail heads provide hiking or mountain biking options. We took the turn to Park City and stopped at Guardsman Pass. We went on a short walk on one of the trails before driving back down. The return drive was equally stunning with different views and the late afternoon light on the mountain peaks meant a few stops to take some more pictures."

Big Cottonwood is home to Moose and spotting a Moose midday at Silver Lake is a really good bet. Silver Lake is handicapped accessible and beautiful"

A blend of private and public land holdings, it has generally resisted excessive development, although the ski resorts have been busy in their footprint acreage. Beautiful colors in the fall contribute to wonderland hikes...as do the late spring wild flowers. In the winter, the crowds tend to be a little more manageable. And summer offers a great time to beat the heat of the Sakt Lake Valley. Lots of bikers and hikers, so be careful on your drive up,the twisting (but well maintained) road. In the summer and fall, you can take the option to cross the ridge and drop into the Park City area...beautiful in color season."

It is one the most scenic drives in Utah. Each time we have guests from out of town in the summer time we take them up over the pass. The pass is closed in winter.\nIf you are visiting from out of town, head up, enjoy the mountains then drive over to Park City for dinner.\nIn summer, there are several hiking trailheads and many places to stop and get out and enjoy the mountains up Big Cottonwood. Stop and play with the kids or bring your camping gear and make it a weekend (or plan ahead and rent a cabin).\nSo much better than staying in Salt Lake.\nIn winter, the snow that piles up in the Cottonwood Canyons is some of the best, lightest, fluffiest, driest, amazingly fun stuff anywhere. If you don't know how to ski powder, take a lesson. It's like dancing through clouds."

     "comment": "The Big Cottonwood Canyon is located south of Park City. You can get here from Salt Lake City via Route 190 (Big Cottonwood Canyon Road) or from Park City via Guardsman Pass.\nIn Brighton, you can find parking in the Silver Lake Information Center or across the street by the general store. There are many lakes and trails depending on your fitness level and desire.\nSilver Lake has a 0.7 mile flat, boardwalk like trail - the easiest one of them all and is absolutely beautiful. We also took the trail to Twin Lakes (a reservoir about 1.25 miles away but over 730 feet upwards - so the distance is deceivingly long. It is a bit challenging considering the high altitude (almost 9000 feet above the sea level). It took us a good 1.5-2 hours for the round trip including a nice stop at the lakes. The Twin Lakes did not have much to look at besides a dam, but the hiking was a great exercise and the view from the top was breathtaking. You can see the entire Brighton area, with Guardsman Pass road in the distance. I wish we had more time to explorer more trails and that we had brought more water with us (we thought we would be back in 30 min for the so-called 1.25 mile trail.\nI would highly recommend visiting the Brighton area if you are in SLC but please use the Route 190 to get here, because the Guardsman Pass road is not for the faint-hearted."

We really enjoyed touring the slopes and the historic town center. A really nice way to spend a half day in this area."

Some nice hikes. But I'm surprised this is the #2 in TripAdvisors Things to Do in Salt Lake City. That's just not right at all. What a screwy ranking system. There are more iconic things to do in town than a trip to these mountains, especially if you have ever seen mountains in your life. If you haven't, then sure they're impressive. But the Rockies have many many places as good or better. Try something that is actually unique to Salt Lake City. It's the #2 ranking that just shocks me and caused me to write a review. If you have already seen everything else in the city and call that #1, then sure this could be #2.\nTemple Square is iconic and unique, and 35 acres (Church Office Building observation deck, Tabernacle organ recital, Family History Library, gardens and fountains, Conference Center auditorium and rooftop garden, etc.) the State Capitol, This is the Place village and Pony Express monument....these ought to be ranked higher than a trip to the mountains. Big Cottonwood is nice but it's not some iconic range like the Tetons or some national park. C'mon. Screwy ranking system here."

We especially like the Brighton area, where they have several places for hiking, biking, fishing and just a great place for food and fun.Last weekend we came within 10 ' of two bull moose ahead of us on the trail. Majestic! You can also drive to the top of the summit (Guardsman Way) and go down the other side heading to either Park City or Heber. Brighton also has lodging at the resort, A little rustic, but so what you're in the mountains right! Skiing in the winter is great with snowboarding allowed and some varied kinds of trails.

I started this hike from the Big Cottonwood Canyon side at the Butler Fork trailhead which is exactly 8.2 miles from taking the left from Rte 210 onto Rte 190, on the left side.\nThe trail is very long. About 8 miles each way. Hiking to Dog Lake and then into the Olympus Wilderness from there. Do not go and take the Big or Little Water trail from Dog Lake. You can take the option of going left and forgoing the Dog Lake destination at the sign that says bear left for Mill A Basin and that takes you towards the Knob and mountain. The trail from the basin trail for the knob and or Mountain from Butler Fork and here is non descript. You'll have to make your own path up possibly until you get to the peak. The top is around 10,500'.\nAfter quite albeit of time out there and a great challenging climb, with some rock scramble to Gobblers Knob, the return back down to join up with the Mills A Basin trail.\nI ended up taking the ridge and then again down a dirt steep slope. After a full day of almost 5 hours hiking, the down return was quite challenging this route.\nA beautiful hike. You definitely need to be in reasonable shape to do the Knob. Going to the mountain would definitely require more time or a dedicated trip and opt out of the Knob. The Goblers Knob in my own opinion is still a great destination."

     "comment": "I did two hikes in one day at Big Cottonwood Canyon -- the Mill B South (aka Lake Blanche Trail) and Lake Mary Trail. Lake Blanche was more challenging -- took me 2.5 hours up and 1.5 hours down. Lake Mary was about 2 hours -- 1.2 hours up and 45 minutes down. You need to be in good physical shape to do Lake Blanche. But the good thing is that most of the Lake Blanche trail is in the shade, through the woods full of Aspen trees. One thing to note: 3/4 of the way up on the trail, it seemed to end at a big boulder field. There was no way to climb the bounders to the peak. I almost turned around and went back. Fortunately, my curiosity got better of me and I climbed the bounder field. 20 feet up, I saw a side trail that continued to the peak. So don't get discouraged by the boulder field -- just climb up and turn the corner.\nLake Mary trail didn't have much shade, but it's a lot shorter. For an average person who only has 2 or 3 hours, then Lake Mary would be a good choice.\nBoth had beautiful views at the end, with the lakes and mountains. If you are in SLC area and are an outdoor enthusiast, you definitely should make a trip to Big Cottonwood Canyon."

     "comment": "The drive up the canyon is a beautiful drive no matter what time you visit, and there's something to do for just about everyone. Plenty of trails to hike, there are several spots that get a lot of rock climbers, you can find great eats at the Silver Fork lodge and cafe, and of course there's the ski resorts of Brighton and Solitude. In Summer months, you can travel all the way up over the top of Guardsman Pass and then either pop over and drop down into Park City, or down into the Heber Valley. The turn backside of Guardsman was \"paved\" a season or two ago, with (I believe) reclaimed ground asphalt, so while it's not a dirt road now, it's still a bit rough. Guardsman Pass is closed in the Winter, but in the Summer, the top of the pass offers great views over the Heber Valley and surrounding mountains. Be aware though that a ton of people start their hiking and mountain biking day at the top of Guardsman, so summer weekends the parking and congestion there can get pretty crazy.\nKeep an eye out in the Canyon for Moose, it's not unusual to see a couple hanging out around the Beaver Ponds. Make sure you stop to read about the \"Blind Miner\" that worked his claim in the Canyon. And with the popularity of drone photography, the \"S Curves\" are becoming a much \"drone photographed\" area. The S curves are also the parking area for several trailheads, so as with the top, parking here can get pretty busy."

When your done with Big Cottonwood canyon head up Little Cottonwood Canyon it's just a short drive away and just as beautiful. If your in town during later September through early November the fall colors are spectacular you won't be disappointed remember use a lower gear on your way down enjoy...."

For those interested in fishing, rock climbing, camping, and more — it's all available. A great place to start your adventures would be Donut Falls, an easier hike that is great for the family."

They have many picnic areas and several places higher up the canyon you can overnight camp. It has some amazing hikes. From easy to difficult you can find all you want. In this canyon you'll see Solitude Ski Resort. At the top of the canyon is Brighton. It's a popular ski resort. Silver Lake is up near Brighton. In the summer you can walk around the lake on the wooden walk path they have built. You'll see some of the most beautiful views in this canyon!"

It was hotter in Utah than it was in Texas, so visiting cool, beautiful Big Cottonwood Canyon provided a welcome respite. It is an easy drive from Salt Lake off 215 with beautiful picnic areas, hiking trails, and even caves. Silver Lake is not only beautiful but easily manageable even with young children. A boardwalk circles the lake, and signs provide interesting information. Park rangers were friendly and knowledgeable and added to the visit. While moose are in the area, we didn't see any during our visit. We did see a beaver dam, ducks, and beautiful flowers. It was 103 in the city but a cool 63 in the canyon. I highly recommend spending time in this beautiful area."

We did the plank walk around Silver Lake and, if we had had the proper equipment -- water supply particularly -- we probably would have taken the walk to Twin Lakes or to Lake Solitude. This truly is God's country and, if you're lucky, you'll see wildlife -- hopefully a moose."

But this canyon is not overly steep and walking back the half mile trail to see the Donut Falls is a must! It's an easy to moderate hike that should take between 20-40 minutes depending on your speed. Try to park in the upper lot so you don't have an extra 2 miles of walking. Once you reach the falls, prepare to do some dangerous climbing if you actually want to get up to the falls. You WILL get wet if you want to get there as well.

The run up there is a sweet ride and posses scenic overkill at every turn. You can stop in at Solitude and snoop around. There are great opportunities to mountain bike or disc golf or hike till your legs give out. There are events at Solitude like the Sunday - 8/7/2016 Taste of the Wasatch. Check Solitudes website. If you go to the top at Brighton there is Silver Lake to see with a great Eco path around the lake to take a short hike around. There are other trails off the main one if you wish to hike up further to other mountain lakes to fish and enjoy. You may see Moose up there and some Japanese tourists frantically taking pictures of Moose foraging. I have seen bull and cow moose up there. Keep your distance and don't try to pet them or feed them. Just take pictures and enjoy them ... at a distance. I fired up my bike with Bullwinkle about 150 yards away and that got his attention as his head popped up with that huge rack to see if I was a threat. Their eyesight isn't all that good but he can smell real well. I dropped it into gear and made way for the exit.\nGo up, cool off, have fun and enjoy the squirrels and chipmunks also(bring nuts and sunflower seed)."

     "comment": "My daughter & I recently visited Salt Lake City and when it became busy downtown during rush hour, we opted to drive through Big Cottonwood Canyon. As you can see in the photos we are submitting, it is very beautiful. We stopped to take photos with the creeks/streams, as well as the mountain views. Worth the 20 minutes outside of downtown. Our rental car had a bit of a tough time climbing the steep mountain, but if you have a stronger car, you can probably go all the way to the ski area at the top (we did not)."

It was around 7:00 in the evening and the temperature was cool in spite of the fact that that it had been close to 100 degrees in the valley during the day. Our walk around the lake was short, but what we saw was varied, big pines, aspens, flowers and views of amazing rocks. It was wonderful to see so many people enjoying the outdoors. I didn't want to leave. I am looking forward to visiting more often and exploring this canyon from corner to corner."

After you've driven about 10 or 11 miles, you arrive at Solitude and Brighton Ski Resorts, both excellent in their own ways. If it's spring, summer or fall, I highly recommend a 30-40 minute walk around the nearby Silver Lake boardwalk. It's good for baby strollers, wheelchairs and all ages and fitness levels. The more adventurous can also take a hiking trail up the mountain. We have often spotted Moose and deer right around the lake. This is a fabulous place to snap family photos."

During the winter months, two wonderful ski resorts are located in the canyon. In the summer months, mountain biking, hiking, camping, etc activities are available high and low. Many rock climbing routes are scattered throughout the canyon as well. Great mountain scenery, especially in the fall as the leaves change color. There are many day route hikes of varying degrees, great fishing holes along the river, and on and on."

     "comment": "I've visited Big Cottonwood in the summer, fall, and winter, and it's beautiful any time of year. Whether you simply want a scenic drive or are looking for more adventurous outdoor activities, you'll find it here. Just 20 minutes from downtown SLC, you'll feel much further away once you enter the canyon. The road up the canyon is about 15 miles long, taking you past sheer cliffs, soaring peaks, and amazing rock formations. There are several spots along the way for hiking, viewing, and photo-taking. At the end of the canyon sit Solitude and Brighton ski areas, both of which offer outstanding skiing at a much lower price and with far fewer crowds than the Park City ski areas. In the summer, fall and spring, you can drive the Guardsman Pass road up and over the mountain to Deer Valley and Park City. The drive takes about 20-30 minutes and provides some incredible views, especially as you cross over the pass. At the pass, there is a small dirt parking area, where you can park your car and go for a hike. From there, you can hike up the backside of Jupiter Bowl and have a beautiful view of the Park City ski area, looking down through Thaynes Canyon."

But of course remember these are wild animals, careful there also might be bears, mountain lions and cougars, and moose's, so stay together, keep dogs on the lease, little one close by.\nAs of now there is SNOW, so dress warm, always bring something, like water to drink, and know what to do, when you get lost, charge the cellphone, just in case.\nDON\"T play games on your devices or listen to music, so you can ENJOY everything around you, and be aware of your surroundings. Inhale the fresh air and enjoy the views, it's a pure delight, I love the mountains and the seasons that change them, don't just take my word for it, GO and SEE it for yourself."

There are places your kids can explore, go fishing or just look at the ducks. It's also a beautiful place to take fall pictures.

Year round a greast place to look for Moose. Early morning hikes it is almost a sure thing to come upon a family of moose. Excellent photo opportunities but do not get too close when you see females with their young. They do get mean. Always keep a tree between you and the moose. Walking around the boardwalk at Silver Lake is a great hike. Do look on both sides of the road during the drive up and down the canyon for all the other fauna. A side trip up Gardsman pass will lead you into Park City or Heber Valley if you want to make a day trip."

The drive further east crossing over to Deer Valley Creek to the 224 was fabulous. Drive north to Park City was great, driving south afterwards to Midway was not really interesting better to drive east towards the 189 or north to Park City. Hope this helps.

Look up and see the scenery of the sky against the shadows of the trees and mountains. It is holy and makes you feel like reading Henry David Thoreau as he would also be impressed. This canyon is still unspoiled by the public such as the roads in California and Aspen near Denver are always mad with traffic. This is a quiet and exciting place to visit."

Sit on the deck and bird watch while enjoying wine and a great meal!"

However, one thing to be cautious is that both Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood canyon are water shed for salt lake county. Dogs, even on leash, are not permitted due to concern of polluting the water. If you bring your pets and get caught, you could be fined $100. Otherwise, it's a great place for great hiking."

Although there was a few spots to pull over, we didn't want to stop & take any photo's because there was a lot of cars heading up towards the ski resorts & everything was just white anyway.

This is a very pleasant drive. One of the must dos when in the SLC area. There is sometimes a charge for Silver lake in the winter time because of snowshoeing and cross country skiing. $5/person.

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon offers breathtaking views and is ideal for both the adventurous as well as those just looking to take in some scenery. If you are looking for hiking, I'd recommend reviewing the types of terrain and level of difficulty of the trails ahead of time so you can select the trail that is right for you. If you just want to take in some scenery, this is a beautiful drive with several places to pull off and appreciate the beauty. Parts of the drive can be very curvy and tight and there are some steep inclines, so if you are afraid of heights or if you are a nervous driver, this might be a bit of a challenge. It seemed like folks drove carefully and were respectful of those who needed to drive a bit slower. Overall, this offers an excellent taste of the mountains and natural beauty and if you are lucky enough you might even get a peek at some wildlife!"

Even at the weekends when the Canyon is very busy it is usually possible to find somewhere to park. For the fit and adventurous there are many trail-heads with trails up into the mountains. Since we are seniors and are not used to the altitude we stick to the flat trail round the lake. There were beautiful Fall colors by mid September as well - particularly is you drive up to Guardsman Pass overlook."

I drove to the top by Brighton Ski Resort and walked around Silver Lake. It's a boardwalk that can be easily walked by all ages and is really beautiful.\nAt the suggestion of the person at the Visitor's Center, I continued up Twin Lakes Trail until I got to the rocks. There I sat and enjoyed the beautiful view of Silver Lake and the \"pikas\" that were getting their nests ready for winter. The trail was rocky in places and unfortunately I wasn't wearing appropriate footwear or I would have continued further.\nI would definitely recommend a visit to Big Cottonwood and as I said, you can make it whatever you want! If I return to SLC I'd definitely wear my hiking shoes and explore some of the other trails."

Out side of popular ski days I prefer to Ski the Little side... I don't like skiing with snowboarders (notice I did not say I don't like snowboarders) so I prefer Alta... but with Brighton next door to Solitude most of the Big Cottonwood snowboarders end up there so Solitude is virtually boarder free.

Lots of mountains in the background and wonderful reflections off the lake itself. We passed a fisherman with 3 or 4 trout from the lake.\nAs I said, it's not a hard walk but well the drive if you haven't done it before."

This was a very pretty ride up through the canyon that culminated at 2 ski resort areas. Traveling in September, we were there before the busy winter season and the area was very quiet, almost deserted. The foliage was starting to show color, and the whole trip was very scenic. There was a pretty little stream following the road, lots of places to safely pull over, enjoy the view and take pictures. Even though we drove at a leisurely pace the whole ride was done in just over an hour. It should be a not-miss ride when visiting the Salt Lake area, it is that pretty and it is that close!"

It follows a curving river along the side of the road graced by picnic areas and hiking trails. One of the best picnic areas is found along the river at the base of Storm Mountain. Each picnic site has a table, a fire pit, and a raised bar-b-que pit. Parking is plentiful. The cost is $8.00 per site per day for up to 8 people. Bring your own wood or charcoal."

It curves and winds up the mountain until you reach the top, following the stream. There's a chance you may spot a deer or moose. You can stop at Solitude ski resort and experience their many activities or go to the end of the road to the Brighton ski resort and hike to one of several mountain lakes. Just a note of caution: the road is narrow and you need to watch for the many cyclists and runners that use it."

     "comment": "I don't know if I'd rate big Cottonwood Canyon the number 1 attraction in SLC, as TA reviewers apparently have. I would agree, however, that it's maybe the number 1 outdoor attraction--at least, if scenic grandeur, skiing, or hiking is what you're looking for. But there are numerous downtown attractions that are more unique to the area, closer to the airport, more easily visited, etc. And Millcreek Canyon, which is much closer to downtown SLC, is in some ways more beautiful than Big Cottonwood (it has more foliage and more spectacular colors in the fall, but is not as breathtaking and rugged).\nBig Cottonwood Canyon is most easily accessed off I-215 (exit 6) onto E 6200 South (Hwy 190). Travel south on 190 about 2 miles to the canyon road and turn left (east).\nThe canyon is a major access road during the winter for two of Utah's biggest ski resorts--Brighton and Solitude. During the fair-weather months the canyon is a spectacular drive (especially for fall colors) or a jumping-off place for numerous hiking and biking trails. Here are a few.\nFirst, 4.5 miles up the canyon the Mill B South interpretive trail (.5 miles long, one-way, which is paved, so great for kids and wheelchairs), and the Lake Blanche trail, which starts from the Miil B trailhead just before the falls and continues for almost three miles past glacier-scarred boulders up the fork to a stunning alpine lake. Across the S-curve and up the road a few hundred feet from Mill B South trailhead is the Hidden Falls trail and the Mill B North Fork trail, which offers great overlooks of the canyon. Both trails are relatively steep and relentlessly uphill.\nSecond, about 8.5 miles up the canyon is the Doughnut Falls trail, named for a waterfall that flows through the hole in a rock. Take the Cardiff Fork (Mill D South Fork) turnoff, then drive 1 1/4 miles to a parking area. An old mining road takes you 3/4 mile to Doughnut Falls, and the Cardiff mine in 2 1/2 miles.\nAt the top of the canyon are the Brighton and Alta ski resorts, a small A-frame store, and on the west side of the Brighton loop road, Silver Lake. The latter offers a nature center, a boardwalk and interpretive trail around the lake, fishing, and connecting trails to Lake Solitude and beyond. But the real treat is the network of trails and alpine lakes (Lake Mary, Martha and Catherine are all simply breathtaking) on the east side of the loop road, above the Alta parking area. Expect to see deer, moose, beautiful wildflowers, and some of the most gorgeous scenery you'll see anywhere in the world short of the Swiss Alps."

Then check out the trails at Storm Mountain. I would also explore Donut Falls. Be careful though. The desire to scramble up the side of the falls has led to many injuries and falls. Some have been fatal. It is on private property and I am uncertain about the rules of access now. It used to be no probem to park and hike. Check out Silver Lake by walking around the lake via the boardwalks, and then if weather permits, drive over Guardsman Pass to Park City."

The drive is windy but not so much as to worry anyone. Each turn in the road offers a new, picturesque view and all are photo worthy.

Trails aren't groomed like many in Zion's or Canyonlands, it is rougher terrain, more mountainous. But given that 20 minutes from the city you can be into an alpine paradise is pretty cool. The weekends can be crowded, but week days are perfect with low volume traffic. The fall colors are spectacular. I saw some individuals climbing as well."

When the day is over mark a place on the calendar to set a point in time to revisit this scenic symphony of wonder.\nThe Good: When you are out in nature enjoy the moment\nThe Bad: After coming back to the city, missing the quite of the mountains\nThe Ugly: some people don't know how to drive slow and miss everything.\nOn the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10 I give this place 10 can't get better than that."

Spring and fall you can photograph the most spectacular wiled flowers covered hills. Winter you can enjoy the winter sports with the best snow. For history lovers: Utah’s beautiful mountains are covered with lots of ancient Indian rock arts."

     "comment": "Since I live nearby, I'm up in this canyon many times a year. I had to laugh a little at the review which said there was no canyon.......??? It's 15 miles long, and at the top are two fantastic ski resorts: Brighton and Solitude. There's definitely a canyon! The road takes you from the valley floor level (about 4800 feet) to the ski bases, which are about 9,000 feet. From there, you can hike (or X-country ski or snowshoe) up higher if you want. The canyon has a number of excellent hiking trails to explore. I recommend stopping at REI or Kirkham's if you're not familiar with the area and pick up a hiking guidebook and some tips and suggestions from the local outdoor enthusiasts who work at either of those stores. Big Cottonwood is a great getaway from the summer heat, and you can grab a good meal at the Silver Fork Lodge on the way up or down (it's 1 mile or 2 from the top) or a burger at the Brighton Village Store."

     "comment": "If you have lived in the Salt Lake valley, you wouldn't have missed this obvious canyon. Lined by a creek, which is one of the watershed areas for the valley, trees along the mountainsides if not interrupted by the rugged, rocky, cliffs, it is a sight to behold for anyone that drives through this wilderness area easily accessible even by the urbane.\nBrighton, the locals favorite and Solitude, the place to get away from the crowd, are probably two of the best ski resorts in the US. These get among the best powder and of the deepest snow in these areas. The road that dead ends in winter at Brighton and goes over the Guardsman Pass over to Park City in summer with an unpaved (but, easy to drive) link, is well maintained throughout the year.\nThe 15-mile long canyon whose mouth is 2 minutes away from a freeway (I-215 belt route) is punctuated by picnic areas, camping sites, hiking trails, fishing area and rock climbing spots. Yet, it is not as crowded as much lesser nature's beauty out towards the coastal regions. The only time you will see a lot of traffic is during and right after closing of the ski area for the day in winter (weekends). The average summer driving time, one-way, is less than 30 minutes.\nCanyons remain about 10-20 degree F cooler than the valley and often remains above the inversion effects that is seen in the valley.\nExpect no public transportation in the summer, but the local public transportation, UTA, plies promptly in winter, carrying skiers/boarders up and down the canyon.\nWater and restrooms are available at some picnic and camping areas. Restaurant and basic facilities at the Brighton and Solitude ski area (more extensively in winter). There is one good restaurant (Silver Fork) about 80% of the way up the canyon. Ski areas are at about the far end of the Canyon."

These are both great ski facilities that are considered to be more 'local' than some of the other resorts in the area. They have great runs and facilities, but are not nearly as crowded or commercialized as the bigger resorts. Fall puts on a great display of colors and there are plenty of great hiking trails to enjoy during the spring and summer."

We found it and after driving around in the gravel parking lot for a bit we found a place to park. Very popular in summer. Crowded. This is a 1 mile RT hike up a gravel and rocky trail. Not paved. Easy to moderate difficulty. Saw many children hiking. Older folks may have a problem. Falls were pretty but not fantastic. Had to hike up the rocky river a bit to get to the falls. We did not do that.\nThe drive thru the park was very nice. There are many other hikes in this park just do your research to fine the best one for you."

From the mossy rocks in the canyon stream, to the spruces and pines, to the scrubby sagebrush and tall aspens, I was simply overwhelmed by this jewel of the American southwest. There are many places to pull off the road and take in the scenery, which I recommend you do frequently: the air has such an earthy perfume, and the view will not disappoint you. Be sure to take along a camera, a comfortable pair of shoes, and a warm sweater for the high altitude (just in case). Above all else, enjoy it. I hope you love this place as much as I did."

When I actually took her on a drive in to the canyon, basically her mouth just hung open the entire time. I know there are more majestic mountains in the country and in the world but to have them so accessible every season of the year and to be able to get out of the car and take a hike of every endurance level you would choose, is something.\nMy husband and I went to Silver Lake this past weekend. Even as many times as I have been there, it's still quite stunning and beautiful. Some of my favorite hikes are Mill B South, of course, the simple stroll around Silver Lake, Spruces, Tanners Flat, Lake Blanche, Gobbler's knob (This can be accessed by both Millcreek and Big Cottonwood canyons) Keep in mind that not all trails are wheelchair accessible but Silver Lake has portions that would be."

On weekends the road can be crowded as there are various place for family outings and folks riding bicycles. Many places to stop and take pictures.\nThis is the road that will take you to Guardsman Pass."

We are not in the greatest shape but were determined once we were committed to doing this. We will treasure this memory always. There are so very many hikes through here. But so thankful we did this one. Even though after another 5 miles down the mountain wi was truly done in."

Stopped at Brighton & took the mile long board-walk loop around Silver Lake. It was beautiful. Took Guardsman's Pass over the mountain to Park City. This is only open summer time. On the outskirts of Brighton as you start on the pass road there's a beautiful look-out where you can see for miles. The pass is only 12 miles, but takes about 35 minutes. It's VERY twisty!"

     "comment": "Welcome to the Wasatch mountain range. The spot from where you enter the canyons till the end of road is just so scenic. There is a spring that flows beside you, downstream and has got cut outs at places where you can stop to smell the grass and see the beauty of running water. Pack a meal and you can just drive down here, and eat it in all the sylvan surroundings. as you climb up the mountain, you will feel the air go colder, and every mile with a new hue and color. there are several spots where you can stay like the solitude and brighton ski resort. we drove till the end of road. There is the silver lake at that spot which has a pathway that goes around it. View from here is awesome and we have found snow till the end of May in those slopes. There are a couple of restaurants up there in the ski resorts as well. Carry water and munchies if you want to hike the other lakes that are well hidden in the mountains. The trek would start form the silver lake of course. All in all a great place with a great geological significance as you get to see the cliffs/hills that remnants of the ancient sea (look for signboards that highlight these). there is a small waterfall (on the right when you drive up) and an ampitheatre (on the left) this waterfall is rough when there is ice in the mountains but quite dry in the summer months. The ride is good, the roads are new and the numerous trails, worth a climb. I know people camp there but have never tried on my own."

A favorite is a quarter mile walk to Hidden Falls at the \"S\" curve, and Silver Lake up at the top of the canyon. Twin Lakes and Lake Solitude are fantastic 1 mile hikes above Silver Lake, and well worth the drive up the canyon to get to the cooler air.

Solitude offer haut cuisine and burgers. Brighton offers skier fare at the base. Molly's offers real meals. There is a small store. Silver Fork has good food breakfast, lunch dinner and beer with a beautiful deck.\nHiking is limitless with day-hikes throughout the canyon to backpacking or cross canyon excursions (see local published guides) . There are also short level walks around the lake at Brighton.\nThe creeks are fast with limited fishing the lakes are more popular.\nThe Autumns are colorful and rival anywhere and amaze that they are such a short drive from the center of Salt Lake City. Access to the canyons is the reason so many people live here. Go enjoy, don't forget to smile."

It was great to see families walking with their young children along the boardwalk pointing out spider webs and small fish. Other families were fishing for trout with success. This is a generous reward for the drive from Salt Lake City. Hint; If you plan to hike the longer trails take the boardwalk to the right from the Visitor's Center and it will be shorter to your to choices. The drive up and down through the canyons reminded us a little of Zion. Early morning or late afternoon and the sun will be your friend taking pictures."

     "comment": "Go here!! This area is just too close to the city of Salt Lake not to take advantage. It's an amazing scenic drive that winds it way into and up the canyon. Snow capped mountains, big Cottonwood Creek:one of the largest streams entering Salt Lake Valley from the east from the Wasatch Mountains, and then there is the potential to see Moose. So just do it! Drive up to the top where Brighton Ski Resort is located, then slowly wind your way back.\nFor those that like to hike, there are many choices and levels, and I would definitely recommend taking a picnic lunch and stopping at one of the picnic stops along the creek.\nNote: There is a fee for parking or use of picnic areas. It is self-pay."

     "comment": "This canyon is 12 miles south of Salt Lake City, and it is a stunning 10 mile climb though a park with ski slopes. When we reached the Brighton Ski area we parked in the large lot, and ventured out to the Silver Lake trail behind the visitor center. There s a very stroller and wheel chair friendly trail that circles the lake. When you reach the one of the ends of the far side of the lake you have the opportunity to continue in a much more rugged trail to Lake Solitude. We went near the middle of June, and there were still spots of snow on the trail around Silver Lake. I am from Pennsylvania so this really impressed me. I had never seen snow before in June. I was in flip flops, but I decided to hike the upward trail to Lake Solitude any way. It was worth the effort. We saw three deer and wild life. There were beautiful views of the canyon. At one point on the trail it is important that you bear left or you will end up down a long hill at a ski lodge. Fortunately we were able to follow people ahead of us who had stopped to watch the passing wild life. The trail got steep toward Lake Solitude and it was rough to do it in flip flops, but I am a rather adventurous type. It is about a one mile trail one way, and we were able to rest, drink water and have a snack at the lake. The chip monks there are very friendly \"or aggressive\" and will beg for food. Going down the trail when it is muddy is more challenging than climbing it.\nWe stopped at a restaurant in the Brighton Recreation Area, but it was closed. On our drive back there is a popular bar and restaurant about half way down on the right. \"The Silver Fork Lodge\". The food was great, but it was little expensive.\nThis trip is a must do if you are visiting Salt Lake City. It only took us a half day to complete, and it was worth the rental car fee. I would do it again, only next time I would choose different shoes. We would have loved to have done Zion Canyon, but it is 4 hours away."

Beautiful drive and enjoyed the easy walk around the lake with several interpretive signs about the animals and vegetation in the area. Unfortunately didn't see any moose, but it was all quite beautiful. If we had had more time would have loved to take one of the trail heads along the canyon and take a hike."

Camping is a favorite for many people and we even had our wedding ceremony at Storm Mountain park. If you are in the Salt Lake area, this is one of the many beautiful canyon to explore here in Utah."

The Crest trail is one of the best mountain bike trails around. Also, both Brighton and Solitude are located in this canyon and are both great ski resorts, popular with the locals. Solitude is especially good during the weekdays as there are very small crowds but great skiing terrain. Brighton is popular with the snowboarding crowd.\nSome of my favorite hikes are in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Dog Lake tops the list. Also, lots of preset rock climbing routes can be found in the canyon as well. The Slips is a popular rock climbing area with climbs of various ratings. Best part about the canyon is that it is only minutes from the Valley. No charge to get up the canyon and the hikes and rock climbs are free. Ski resorts to charge. Check their websites for current pricing."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon (BCC) offers great hikes, camping, winter skiing and snowboarding as well as incredible views. BCC is part of the Wasatch Mountain Range. There are some challenging hikes as well as some easy hikes during the spring, summer and fall. Please go to http://hikesandlakes.com/bigcottonwoodcanyon.html for a description of the hikes available and how to reach them. Be sure to have breakfast or lunch at the Silver Fork lodge on the way up the canyon. There are parts of the canyon where dogs are not allowed because it is a watershed area. Be sure to verify before bringing your canine hiking companion. Also, be weather wise for storms if on the forecast as lightning can be an issue. 6,500 to 10,000 ft. elevation. Dress with layers and bring water/food.\nDuring ski season, there are immediate area hotels in Cottonwood Heights and Sandy, Utah, which means you can be up the ski hill in 25 to 40 minutes. Ski buses pick up boarders and ski buffs at the parking lot at the base of BCC.\nThere are also ski season and summer rentals up the mountain. Many are connected to Solitude Resort or Brighton Resort. Not all trails give access to bicycles. No ATVs or motorcycles on hiking trails. These are mountain trails and not wheel chair accessible.\nEnjoy this beautiful area."

     "comment": "My husband and I recently relocated to SLC from Nebraska. The mountains are breathtaking! We are still acclimating to the higher elevation it seems, but some of the hikes are still doable for us. Even just driving you'll get some great views, but the hiking is even more beautiful.\nSilver Lake is more of a walk for those who can't \"hike,\" but it is at a very high elevation. We have even seen a moose! If unable to hike/walk around the lake, at least drive up to see it. It's literally right down the road from Brighton ski resort.\nThe Donut Falls hike isn't as strenuous as other hikes, but be warned it may be difficult in a few spots for little kids. We encountered a mom with three little ones, and my husband all but carried two of the kids across the river there and back, but even if you just go as far as the river and turn around, you've still seen very beautiful views. Also, we have seen a moose right off the road by the main parking lot here.\nJust a note, as it was confusing to us at first, I wouldn't recommend parking in the parking lot on the main canyon road; take a right and head down the narrow road to the head of the trail, unless you feel up to a very long walk, the hike, then another very long walk back to your car. Parking is quite limited at the trailhead though."

     "comment": "So my daughter and I, and sister in law, had done lessons over Christmas here. Our teachers were simply wonderful. Don Johnson, my teacher, really improved my technique and confidence (my 4th lesson). But in March, we thought we'd try an area we hadn't skied, And Alta is always high on everyone's list. So, we tried it. Not fun. For one, the lessons for kids are huge in scale, they didn't pay much attention to individuals. Second, for my lesson, the guy gave me no help and instilled fear of skiing in me. I decided it was time to return to Solitude. That was the best decision! I found Don again, by chance, and he showed me how I was leaning back, gave me exercises to improve my technique and had me enjoying myself and doing much better by the end of the lesson going down Moonbeam. He basically saved skiing for me. He even had notes on me from December! The long beginner's hill was much better for my sister in law. It is small, intimate and caring. And no lines. Frankly, it's the best."

This trip allowed us to see the early glimpses of Spring. The Canyon terrain itself is showings buds on trees and shrubs, as well as a short growth of green grasses. Looking up toward Mount Olympus shows new growth on the pines, and topped with fresh powder giving great contrast and providing for stunning photo's. From taking pictures to getting your hiking on you will find something to smile about. From Big Cottonwood you can also enjoying the views to the west of the canyon, of the Oquirrh Mountains off in the distance."

     "comment": "We hiked Lake Blanche on Friday October 10 and it was perfect! The weather could not have been more gorgeous, and the fall colors were out in full force. All in, this hike took us about 4 hours.... Not gonna lie, it was tough! The first 2-ish hours were uphill, until you get to the lake. We took several stops on the way up, to catch our breath, drink water, and snap photos. The scenery along this hike is breathtaking, one of the most beautiful places I've visited. Once you reach the top, Lake Blanche is equally beautiful - incredibly peaceful and serene. We didn't see many people on the way up (started around 8:15 am), but saw lots of folks on the way down. If you're in reasonable shape, I would 100% do this hike."

The fog and storm clouds made the mountain so mystical and romantic. It was breathtaking driving around every bend and turn. During the fall, the trees were changing colors and the forest was incredible! We couldn't help ourselves and had to stop every few minutes or so and snap photos. It was so refreshing being in the storm in the middle of the canyon! Stop by Park City and enjoy a cup of coffee and shop the boutique stores!"

     "comment": "I guess we were a bit \"snobbish\" about our outdoor experiences after living in northwest Montana for many years; although we have found wonderful sights and adventures in Utah. It always seemed that the hikes near Salt Lake City were overused and underwhelming. Although Big Cottonwood Canyon is a busy place, a group of friends hiked up to Lake Solitude last week and found, well, solitude. And no mosquitoes. The trail starts at the Silver Lake center (restrooms available) and is a pretty easy 1.5 mile hike up to a small, yet pretty lake. Anyone (almost, there is a somewhat steep short portion just before arriving at the lake) could do this easy trail. I recommend it for a little morning getaway. We headed up the trail around 10 a.m. We only saw a very few people on our way up, then had the lake to ourselves for about 20 minutes. On our way back down the trail we passed quite a few people as they ventured up. Now I regret not doing more cerca-City exploring over the years. It was really a delightful morning."

We were so disappointed however that when we arrived at silver lake we just missed out on the moose which had been sunbathing for more than an hour. Some people told us that it went into the bushes just before we arrived. It was still a lovely place to visit and the walk through the trees from solitude to silver lake as it was really peaceful as there were hardly any people around. The drive through the canyon was beautiful and only 20 mins drive from the hustle and bustle of the city."

We drove about 12 miles in to the lake and did both the board walk hike which is short and east for anyone and is accessible so perfect for kids, seniors or whatever – and has awesome views of the lake and mountains!

In 10 minutes, you can be off of I-215 and into a rugged, mountainous chasm on the way to waterfalls, woods, and alpine lakes and peaks.\nBesides the obvious (skiing), I've enjoyed sport climbing, hiking, snowshoeing, camping, scrambling, and picnicking in Big Cottonwood. It is a great place for all of the above.\nParking is either excellent or challenging, depending upon the crowds and where you plan to go (Silver Lake Trailhead: easy, S-Curve Trailhead: tougher on a busy summer day unless you get there early).\nLake Blanche is a prototypical alpine lake: clear, beautiful water with wildflowers below and craggy peaks above. The lake is a great place to start if you are wanting to delve deeper into the Wasatch Range, away from the roads and ski resorts."

Yes, there is several all over the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon but as a pro photographer Mary's lake is not to bad of a hike with newer, easier trails and the landscape in and around Mary's Lake is awesome and good for cliff jumping too. Martha and Cathrine are for the die-hard's because once you get to Mary's its hard to leave it but please do yourself a favor and press on, its worth it.\nFor a easier way to see the sisters, go up Little Cottonwood Canyon, go to Albien Basin and you'll find Cathrine pass... going downhill the whole time makes it easier for the younger or inexperienced ones. Bring lots of water or a filter for the lakes. Its a water shed area, leave the dogs at home."

It is a truly beautiful drive, with lovely views all around. There are also plenty of trails along the road -- my husband and I just stopped at a few, and walked to Doughnut Falls and some of Mill B. I think you could either plan out where you want to hike, or do kind of like we did and just stop when you feel like it! We also took Guardsman Pass to Midway -- it's a tricky curvy drive up the mountain, closed in the winter, but when we were there in July it was really beautiful. We are really glad we took the \"long way\" through Cottonwood Canyon to my cousin's house instead of taking the interstate -- we enjoyed the drive and the hikes!"

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood is a great canyon for a leisurely afternoon drive or picnic. There are numerous picnic tables along the route. At the top of the canyon, you can enjoy an easy walk around Silver Lake or stop in at the visitor center for more information on local plants and wildlife. This canyon is linked to Heber and Park City via Guardsmans Pass at the top of the canyon (just before Brighton). Guardman's isn't paved the whole way, but it's good enough to take a sedan. Note: dogs are not allowed in this canyon as it is a watershed area."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood Canyon has lots of great hikes for all different levels of hikers. Donut Falls is a lovely easy hike and for more moderate ones Dog Lake with a detour to Desolation Lake is also wonderful. Up the highway you also find Silver Lake just beyond Solitude Ski Resort and numerous easy hikes at Brighton Resort. The Lake Mary and Lake Catherine's hikes are a definite must. Be aware that you may see moose on these hikes. A great area to enjoy family recreation. Both Brighton and Solitude are also wonderful places to ski and snowboard during the snow months. Enjoy!"

     "comment": "Nice places to picnic by a babbling stream along the route to Solitude & Brighton ski resorts. There was still snow above 7,000 ft. The Guardman Pass was closed until around the beginning of June, as it's around 10,000 ft. Hence, there was no way to get through to Park City from here in May. A popular place for the locals for a Sunday drive. Lovely scenery, but many trees at the higher elevations are not in leaf yet. It must be an even better drive from June & throughout the summer. The canyon walls coming down from the ski areas are extremely picturesque when the sun is on them."

Also, take along a geologist to explain the fabulous and varied rock formations. Be prepared for hairpin turns, a beautiful stream (be careful not to polute anything in the pristine canyons).\nLook out for rock climbers ... tiny dots on the granite faces. There are places to hike and cross country ski. Solitude is one of my favorite ski areas when the snow is fresh and the sun shines ... otherwise not that great. Brighton is great on a snowy day because there are many trails through the trees. Both have good lunch menus in season. Enjoy1"

Take plenty of fluid and wear sunscreen, as with any hike in this region. It is amazing how close this fantastic valley is to the city. Take advantage of it!"

This is a beautiful alpine lake with an easy boardwalk loop around most of the lake.The lake was clear and while I didn't see any bears or moose, I am sure they were out there. This was another place that was at the top of our list of fun things from our vacation, and to think we almost missed it!!

Delta non-stop from New Orleans to SLC- Arrives 10:30am, departs 5:30pm.\nSalt Lake City airport to Solitude just 35-40 minutes (rental car or shuttle). Can be skiing with a half-day ticket on first day and can ski right up to the shuttle, pop your skis off, hop in and head to the airport on last day (if you own your own equipment).\n-Price of equipment and tickets are very reasonable.\nWe purchase season tickets off the website in the late summer / early fall. Packages are very good. Our son skis for $25.00/day (lift ticket) as a junior and total rental package is $25.00/day. Husband $49.00/day for lift ticket. Equipment is quality.\n-Friendly, knowledgeable, dedicated staff\nFrom the manager of the Solitude’s Snowsports Academy, Leif, to the seasonal workers (ski instructors, rental area, lift operators), we always feel completely welcomed and properly cared for. We have been using the same instructors for years and would highly recommend both, Ron Cook and Helen. Both will up your skiing game every time you ski with them. Ski trips are about skiing. Do not torture yourself. Spend some money on instruction. My son skis double blacks and Ron improves his skills every time and no one knows those dangerous Honeycomb runs like Ron. Worth every penny.\n-No lines. No waits for all that beautiful snow.\n-Great lodging and helpful, friendly staff.\n-Big Cottonwood canyon is seldom closed due to avalanches. Road closures can really ruin your limited vacation time.\n-Good, quality food at lodge and at Silver Fork Lodge.\n-Snow, snow, snow!!!\nThe list goes on and on."

Continuing up the mountain you will pass by several ski resorts and continue to the small town of Brighton. There you will find a very tranquil and beautiful walk around Silver Lake. This is a real alpine lake and the scenery is splendid. Half way around the lake, there is a cut off to the twin lakes trail. Easy trail with a 700 ft incline in a 1 1/2 miles. Outstanding!\nFrom Brighton, you can take the road up to Guardsman Pass at 11000 feet elevation. You are on top of the world at this point. The views are unparrelled.\nFrom Guardsman Pass you drive down the mountain and take the cut off to Midway. Again another spectacular drive. Have a picnic lunch at the visitor center in Midway. After that, take the drive up to Snake Canyon...Scenery here does not get much better......Can't wait to do it again. We were very fortunate as the foliage was almost peaking throughout out drives. The reds, oranges, the contrast with the evergreens and of course the golden leaves of the aspen trees. What a sight anf lots of colorful memories."

Some of my favorites are Donut Falls and Silver Lake( both great for all ages/fitness levels), and Lake Catherine and Twin Lakes/Lake Solitude. But that only scratches the surface.\nGreat fall foliage drive too!"

We packed plenty of snacks and water. When we got to Lake Blanche we had our brunch overlooking the lake and then continued hiking past the dam to two other lakes! It was so beautiful to see the lakes and the views going up the canyon. We weren't very tired when we got back to the parking lot so we decided to do the Broads Fork trail as well. It was much more difficult but had fewer people on it. Overall, we had a great 8 hours worth of hiking and would recommend both hikes to anyone in decent shape!"

With one evening to do sightseeing, this was a great choice. The drive up the canyon was picturesque, and not at all like what I was expecting. We saw rock climbers along the way, and I was thinking my son would have loved it here. We were headed for the Silver Fork, but decided to look around before dinner while we still had daylight. The walk around Spring Lake at then end of the drive was a must-do. We had hoped to see some moose, but not today. I was surprised to realize we were over 8000 feet elevation - it didn't feel like it. And the cool, dry air was a pleasant change from the 95F in the city. After dinner, we continued up some side roads until it got dark, and headed back to our hotel. The side roads were not for the faint of heart - steep drop-offs and no guardrails! Wouldn't want to drive there when the roads were icy!"

     "comment": "A week ago I had a few hours with my wife and she wanted to go for a hike - So we drove to the canyon and started driving up. I took her to a favorite trail of mine and we hit the trail. Parking at the 'S' curve, we headed up the Broads Fork trail. Within minutes we were in another world. Sure we could hear the cars streaming up and down the canyon, but the aroma of pine trees and wild flowers melted the din into an unobtrusive aside.\nWe both loved just being out in the wild, unattached and undeterred by the electronic junk that dominates our day to day living. yes, we had no cell service - HOORAY!\n45 minutes up the trail (probably 25 for the faster moving crowd) we came upon a huge rock. We paused to enjoy its unique form and then continued up a ways. We passed only 2 other people on our trek up and I pondered the proximity to more than a million people only a few miles away, and here we were in solitude.\nAfter an hour we turned back and quickly retraced our steps. The trail was alot steeper on the way down, but we managed. Soon we arrived back at the parking lot and rested by the rushing waters of the mountain stream. We didn't want to leave and so we just basked in the overpowering sound of the rushing water.\nYou know we will be back"

     "comment": "I just spent a week in the SLC region, hiking and sightseeing. The mountain scenery, especially with late snow on the peaks, is fantastic. But be forewarned - the trail systems leave a lot to be desired, particularly in regard to signage. I have hiked in NH, ME, VT, MA, CT, NY, WY, CO, and MT, but have never seen a trail system that is totally unmarked like the trail system in the Wasatch Mountains.\nMost trail heads are unmarked other than by a sign saying \"Trail\". A bit further on, there'll be sign saying \"Stay on the trail\". That is usually followed by a number of heavily trodden trails going in multiple directions, with no designation of which is the correct one. Trying to determine which is correct is impossible, since all appear to be maintained, with waterbars and stone steps. And yet., printed trail maps show only one distinct trail. If you're lucky enough to not get totally lost, you'll be rewarded with fantastic views, but will only have a vague idea of where you are. The comment of the 'locals' is \"Well, you get used to it.\" Big canyon, small canyon, it dosen't matter, they're all the same. Good luck!"

     "comment": "I lived back East for a decade and these canyons are a major reason I couldn't stay away any longer. Now I've lived in Salt Lake for years and still haven't explored every area of this canyon. There is always something new to challenge. Most people will just drive up and down or do a couple of short hikes or picnics. But there are literally hundreds of trails to inspire.\nThere is a connection with the natural world and extreme wilderness so close to a major urban center, which is a unique feature most cities don't have. Every season has options, from skiing to climbing, biking or hiking. The real canyon must be explored away from the car and road. Here is where you will encounter moose, mountain goats, and view Salt Lake City from 10,000 foot mountain peaks. That view must be earned.\nIf nothing else, it's always a nice day heading up the canyon relaxing."

     "comment": "There are a number of spectacular hikes up Big Cottonwood: the Mill B South interpretive trail is paved, so great for kids and wheelchairs; the Lake Blanche trail starts from the Miil B trailhead just before the falls, and continues for almost three miles past glacier-scarred boulders up the fork to a stunning alpine lake; across road is the Hidden Falls trail and the Mill B North Fork, which offers great overlooks. At the top of the canyon are Brighton and Alta, both great skiing destinations in winter, but in summer they are equally beautiful.\nSilver Lake offers a nature center, a boardwalk, and an interpretive trail which connects up with trails to Silver lake and Lake Solitude. But the real treat is the network of trails and alpine lakes (Lake Mary, Martha and Catherine are all simply breathtaking) above the Alta parking area. Expect to see deer, moose, beautiful wildflowers, and some of the most gorgeous scenery you'll see anywhere in the world short of the Swiss Alps."

     "comment": "I have driven up this canyon hundreds of times. It is beyond beautiful, in every season. It's hard to imagine a more beautiful place so close to a major city. And it comes with a huge variety of activities, great for all ages. You can fish in the lakes at the top (including Silver Lake, which is an easy walk from the parking lot), hike on trails of any level of difficulty, incomparable skiing in the winter, and many more.\nTo state the obvious, it does get a huge amount of snow in the winter, so be prepared. You do not want to be driving up or down the canyon in a blizzard, and oftentimes they close the road and won't let you anyway."

Utah is definitely a staple of natural beauty and this is a must-see if you're into that.\nBeautiful scenery and a lovely way to spend an off day. Rejuvenates you by just being disconnected from the world, let alone all the calm surroundings.\nHowever, that being said, it's very convenient to get to everywhere around it if you want to get a bite to eat at a local restaurant."

But if you're out for an adventurous drive when the road's been plowed, take the trip over the pass to Park City. If I lived in Utah, that, rather than I-80, would be my route between SLC and PC when the snow allows."

     "comment": "Great for skiing, hiking, having a picnic, or just for a scenic drive. Brighton and Solitude ski resorts are very nice, and Silver Fork lake is a lovely destination with a boardwalk that's wheelchair accessible during the summer months. It's a flat, easy walk around the lake, and there are trail heads for the more adventurous. The terrain is quite different from Little Cottonwood Canyon, despite being right next to it. (If I remember correctly, one was formed by a glacier, the other by a river.) It's about a 20 minute drive from downtown SLC to the mouth of the canyon, and about another 20 minutes to the top of the canyon. Silver Fork Lodge, near the top of the canyon, is a great place to stop for a meal."

     "comment": "If you are in Salt Lake City, you don't have to travel very far to experience the peace and beauty of nature. There are so many places to explore, but Big Cottonwood Canyon is one of the best places to start. My favorite place to go is Silver Lake. It's a great place to take a walk, or enjoy a picnic lunch. If you are feeling more adventurous, there are also several lakes you can hike to from there. (Hope you remembered to bring your camera or phone to take pictures!)\nFor hiking ideas, there is a place you can get information at the start of the Silver Lake trail. There are also restrooms there.\nThe trails to Twin Lake and Lake Solitude start on the North side of Silver Lake. From the fork, you can go left to Twin Lake or Right to Lake Solitude.\nTwin Lake: My favorite part of the trail to Twin Lake is the section that cuts through an aspen forest. After that the trail gets pretty rocky and I didn't enjoy that as much in the hot sun. Not the best trail to hike mid-day! When I arrived at Twin Lake (Reservoir) I was a little disappointed with the view and not sure if I would care to hike this trail again. My sister and I decided to take a \"short cut\" down the road on the way back and I don't recommend doing that. It was faster, yes, but too steep for me. I'd rather go back the way I came next time even if it's longer. Too hard on my knees. Guess I'm a wimp. :)\nLake Solitude: This was my favorite trail to hike. Beautiful aspens, lots of wildflowers, deer...and possibly other wildlife. This trail felt very isolated to me, I wouldn't feel very comfortable hiking this one alone, but I could do this trail again and again. The lake at the end of the trail looked like a moose pond. It wasn't big, but it was pretty. Definitely a place of \"solitude.\"\n___________\nDog Lake/Lake Mary: This trail starts out at Brighton Ski Resort. The beginning of the trail is pretty steep, it begins right up the hill near the ski lift. The trail is easy to follow from there. (Restrooms back at Silver Lake) It was a nice trail that just seems to keep going up, up, up. Bring water...and a picnic lunch while you're at it. Dog Lake was a nice, easy, short walk to a very pretty and isolated moose pond. (No moose when I was there) Worth the short walk to see it, for sure! The trail to Lake Mary is also worth the hike. I wasn't disappointed once the picturesque lake (reservoir) came into view. I was glad I brought my camera! There were several families up there enjoying a picnic and I was wishing I was more prepared...maybe next time."

A great hike for children and the elderly is up close to Brighton Ski resort. Its called Silver Lake. It makes a nice big, pretty much level, loop around this small lake. If you want to extend this hike you can go to Lake Solitude for a wonderful view. It is more of an up hill hike but so worth it. You will often see moose up this canyon and deer. In August the wildflowers up in the Albion Basin area are spectacular. The hike to Donut Falls, about 1/2 way up the canyon is also a nice one. There are several great camp grounds up this canyon. The Spruces and Redmonds are 2 of my favorites."

We took seven young children ages 11 months to ten years. All made it safely. The trail is relatively smooth and well groomed until the very end. You can stop at the base of the falls or continue on the rocks to get closer to the falls. The scenery is beautiful and the length is perfect for young hikers . . . It's less than a mile each way. There is a pit toilet at the trail head and limited parking nearby (about 20 spaces). We wend on a summer weekday, but apparently you can go year round, if you like to snowshoe in the winter."

The snow on this side of the mountains is more reliable than the Park City area, and you have 2 great options. Solitude is more sophisticated, with a village and condos, but still has more of a personal feel, not so large and commercial."

Cross country, downhill, snow boarding ... it is a winter wonderland. Snow usually lingers well into spring and sometimes into summer at the higher elevations. We've camped in snow in June and experienced snowfall in August.\nMy favorite time of the year in Big Cottonwood is summer. It's a great place to escape the summer heat for a picnic, a hike or a weekend campout. There are several picnic areas and trailheads just off the road. Three camp areas are usually very busy all summer. We have an annual family reunion at Jordan Pines (group sites only). Spruces and Redman campgrounds have single and group camp sites.\nStorm Mountain is very popular for picnics, hiking and rock climbing. Donut Falls and Silver Lake are popular destinations. Other hikes take the adventurous higher and deeper into the mountains. The canyon road is popular with bicyclists. The creek provides some fun fishing.\nBig Cottonwood Canyon is certainly a treasure in the Wasatch Mountains!"

Our children learned to ski at Brighton and they loved the variety of skiing from beginner to double black diamond runs. Solitude is also a great ski area right next door for variety and a beautiful ski village. There doesn't ever seem to be a wait for lifts at either place.Hiking in season is terrific. The hike to Mary's Lake is fun and scenic. Trails are fun for all age groups. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in addition to skiing in winter. A plus and a minus at same time is the limited visitor accommodations but easily accessible to downtown SLC. Also, we take the bus from DT SLC and that is relaxing and you meet nice people."

Canyons and Deer Valley were also outstanding. 1 hour from SLC airport to the slopes, easy drive in almost any weather. Weather was very mild, more like spring skiing, but snow held up pretty well. Plan to do it again next year."

Too many people are finding out that in just minutes you can be from the valley into the most beautiful mountain scenery you can imagine. If you do visit don't tell anyone. We kinda like to keep it to ourselves. Plenty of camping / picnic areas available but sometimes you have to plan well to get one now that the secret is out."

Take a drive to see Fall colors or an amazing vista of valleys and peaks at the top of the canyon (great year round but can get slushy and sketchy for people not accustomed to driving narrow canyons with steep drop-offs and snow), skiing or brunch/lunch at the resorts, an easy hike around Silver Lake (part has boardwalk, the rest is a dirt path, walkable in flip flops or hiking shoes), or sight wildlife (we've seen a golden eagle swoop down to scoop up road kill about 20 feet away, 2 bald eagles, moose, etc.). The drive is also spectacular, winding along next to a river filled with little trout, steep cliffs rising straight up at certain points. Some summer weekend afternoons we escape the city heat and take a quick picnic up and sit by the river."

     "comment": "Big Cottonwood has a lot of hiking options. With young kids, we love the Silver Lake walk at the base of Brighton ski resort. We have seen moose in the shallows here about a third of the time, munching away on the water plants. The rangers come out and keep you at a safe distance. There are dozens of trails for hikes into waterfalls, with widely varying levels of difficulty. Donut Falls is popular and can be crowded in summer. There are many internet sites that describe the various trails, and it is worth doing some research in advance. The Silver Fork Restaurant is about half way up the canyon. Its deck is very popular for summer weekend brunches and as an after ski place in the winter. The Porcupine Grill at the base of the Canyon in SLC is another after ski hot spot for beer, pizza, and pub food."

Summer: Hiking, Rock climbing, Biking, Fishing, camping Etc...I can't even begin to mention all the trails or adventures I have experienced up that canyon. A popular hike in both Winter and Summer is doughnut falls. I go up there mostly to Rock Climb because it is a good place with a variety of difficulties. Meet your friends at the park and ride and carpool up to your venue. This canyon is one just like those \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books. Choose what sport you will play next!"

There is a grassy area to the west and a few plaques. The only issue is I'm not sure where you can legally stop to get a few photos.

Either way, Will is a must see. The din of I 80 traffic passing by. The winds of the high desert, and the lights of the casinos shimmering just a few blocks away."

We parked in front of it, just a little off of the road, which is probably not what the township wants you to do, but the traffic was very light. We hopped out very quickly and took a quick picture."

Denner had just completed the Vegas Vic sign that was erected in 1951. The sign was constructed by The Young Electric Sign Company.\nWendover Will was named after the town of Wendover and William Smith, who founded the Stateline Casino. The 63-foot-tall (19 m) sign was intended to draw travelers in from US Highways 40 and 50, later known as Interstate 80. The sign includes 1,184 feet (361 m) of neon tubing.[2] When driving east on Interstate 80 a caption under the sign reads, \"This is the place,\" apparently in homage to Brigham Young. When driving west the caption reads, \"Where the West begins\"."

He has two brothers made by Young Electric Sign Co: Vegas Vic, (downtown Vegas) and River Rick (Laughlin NV). A must see, and the easiest way / beacon to find Smiths, when you run out of beef jerky and bourbon."

At the Montego Bay Casino, there's a restored Lincoln Hwy marker--a later alignment of the Lincoln was routed to Wendover then down to Ely. And Wendover was also along the Victory Hwy (back when roads had names not numbers), named for the WW1 veterans. Wendover Will used to sit by one of the casinos some years ago, but now he has been relocated to the west side of town, on the old highway leading out to rejoin the interstate. It's nice to see a remnant of the old road culture survive in 2015."

There is a place to park and get out to see him and take pictures. We stopped in the day time and them came back at night when he is all lit up with Neon. When in Wendover you must see this."

She was generally interested in us and our Road Trip, and we wers asked to sign their guestbook.\nThanks Nevada I'm sure we will return to explore more of your state in the coming years."

Most of the displays were of the history of Wendovers important training role during the years of 1944-1945, Bonneville Flats and racing.\nThe woman that worked there was very knowledgeable about the history of Wendover and she was very friendly.\nHubby managed to find a silver medallion to buy and also another less expensive one. He collects medallions so he was excited to get these from Wendovers anniversary.\nThis free visit was worth our time and we would recommend you to go when you’re in Wendover."

It goes back to the time of Wendover AFB, where training occurred for the ending of WWII. There are lots of great photos and interesting artifacts, giving you a real sense of the times. The folks are friendly, knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. It's not your regular \"travel through\" resting place and you'll enjoy spending an hour to give yourself a stretch break. I give them an A+ and highly recommend it."
